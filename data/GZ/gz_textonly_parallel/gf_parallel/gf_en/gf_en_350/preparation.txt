To prepare mashed potatoes, start by boiling them. Place them into a large saucepan, covering with plenty of cold water. Put the pan over heat, and as soon as the water has reached its boiling point, cook for 30 to 50 minutes. Remember that times are always indicative, and depend on the size of the potatoes. For this reason it is advisable to occasionally do the fork test: if the forkÂ enter easily, then the potatoes are cooked [1]. Drain and let cool just for a few minutes [2], because you will have to take advantage of the potatoes being hot in order to peel them easily [3].
After peeling the potatoes, pour them into the potato masher, or use a masher or a fork (if you use the latter you will obtain a less fine consistency), and put them directly into the cooking pan [4]. Then adjust the taste with a pinch of salt and grate some nutmeg [5]. In the meantime, heat the milk in a small saucepan [6].
Put the mash over low heat, and when the milk is hot, pour it inside [7] and stir with a whisk until it has been completely absorbed. This will take a few moments [8]. Then turn off the heat and add butter [9]
and Parmesan cheese [10]. Give it one last mix to amalgamate everything [11], and your mashed potatoes are ready [12]!
