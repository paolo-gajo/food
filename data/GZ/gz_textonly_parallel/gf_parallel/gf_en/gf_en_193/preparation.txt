To prepare radicchio and pancetta risotto, start by preparing the vegetable stock, which you'll need to keep hot. Remove the white part of the radicchio head [1]. Now wash, dry and thinly slice the leaves [2] [3],
Place the oil and finely chopped shallot in a large pan [4]. Brown on a medium flame, stirring every now and then. Add a ladle of vegetable stock [5] followed by the pancetta bacon a few moments later, cut into thin strips [6].
Leave the pancetta bacon to cook for 1-2 minutes and stir occasionally. Now add the rice [7] and stir some more. Toast the rice until you see the grains become semi-transparent [8]. Now add the red wine, simmer and reduce before adding as much hot stock as necessary [9], one or two ladles at a time: the rice must always remain covered.
Finish cooking the rice (it will take around 18 minutes, depending on what rice you use). Once cooked, add salt [10] and pepper [11] to taste. Lastly, add the radicchio once removed from the flame. Stir [12], flavor with the thyme and now you're ready to serve you radicchio and pancetta risotto on plates.
