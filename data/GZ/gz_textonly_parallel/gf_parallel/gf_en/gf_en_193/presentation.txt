If you are looking for a risotto with a full-bodied flavor, then radicchio and pancetta risotto is the one for you. Radicchio risotto is a classic of Veneto culinary tradition; we have reinterpreted and enriched it with delicious smoked pancetta bacon, for a decisive touch, which balances the unmistakably bitter flavor of radicchio. Chioggia radicchio is a cross between endive and travois radicchio. The latter has a slightly less bitter flavor, and if you prefer this variety, we recommend you try the lasagna with radicchio and Montasio cheese.
