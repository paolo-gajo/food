To make the candied almonds, first prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Now take a pan, possibly stainless steel, and pour in the almonds [1], sugar [2], and room-temperature water [3].
Turn the heat to medium-low and begin to stir: The water and sugar mixture will be very runny at first [4], and then it will start to boil [5] and finally crystallize, forming a coating around the almonds [6].
At this point, turn the heat down slightly and continue stirring until the sugar starts to caramelize [7] and takes on a dark amber color [8]. Once theyâ€™ve turned brown, pour the almonds out onto the baking sheet lined with parchment paper, taking care to spread them out as much as possible [9]. As they cool, separate them with your hands to keep them from sticking to each other. Your candied almonds are ready to be eaten or given away!
