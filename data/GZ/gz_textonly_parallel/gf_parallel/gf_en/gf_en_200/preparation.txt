To prepare pumpkin cream, start by preparing the vegetable stock. Now clean the pumpkin. Cut it into slices [1], remove the peel and the seeds inside; now you need 1.32 lb (600 g) of pulp, diced [2]. Peel the potatoes [3]
and dice them too [4]. Peel and finely chop the onion [5], then place it in a pan with the oil; leave to brown on a low flame [6].
Once the onion changes color, add the pumpkin [7] and the potatoes [8] too. Add part of the vegetable stock to cover all the vegetables [9]; you'll add the remaining part later.
Add salt and pepper to taste [10]. Leave to cook on a low flame for 25/30 minutes [11] and add a little vegetable stock at a time. Once the vegetables finish cooking, remove from the heat and blend with an immersion mixer [12],
to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream. Now add the cinnamon [13], the nutmeg [14], and stir. Your pumpkin cream is ready now! Serve with some delicious croutons by cutting the bread into cubes that aren't too small [15]
and placing them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with oil [16] and bake for around 5 minutes in a preheated oven set to grill, then remove [17]. Serve the pumpkin cream in a soup bowl, with a sprinkling of croutons [18].
