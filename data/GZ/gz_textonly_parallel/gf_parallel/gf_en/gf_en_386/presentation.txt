What will you prepare on the scariest night of the year? If you are looking for a "scream" decoration, the Halloween cake is the one for you!  Halloween is a holiday that is becoming increasingly popular also in Italy, where delicious cakes are prepared. This dessert consists of a fluffy pumpkin pie split in two to get a milk and a chocolate layer. Inside you will discover a filling with abundant cream cheese and strawberry jam.  Thanks to the decoration that we propose today you will get a Halloween drip cake, scary at the right point and very colorful, suitable even for the little ones. It will be enough to have a little familiarity with pastry bags to make the meringue ghosts to complete the dessert!
