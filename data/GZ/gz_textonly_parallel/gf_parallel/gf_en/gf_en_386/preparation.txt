To prepare the Halloween cake, first take care of the basic dough. Clean the pumpkin and cut it into cubes, you will need to obtain 500 g. Then transfer the pumpkin into a tall-sided bowl [1] and add the oil [2] and milk [3].
Blend everything with an immersion mixer [4] until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream [5]. Coarsely chop the dark chocolate and melt it in the microwave or in a bain-marie, let it cool. In another large bowl, pour the eggs and brown sugar [6].
Mix with the electric whisk [7], until you get a frothy mixture. Now add the pumpkin cream [8] and whisk for a minute, until it is well blended.  Add flour 00 [9] to the mixture,
almond flour [10] and baking powder [11]. Mix with electric whips at low speed [12],
until a smooth and homogeneous mixture is obtained [13]. Divide the dough in two equal parts [14] and add the previously melted dark chocolate to one of them, now lukewarm [15].
Mix with a hand whisk until a homogeneous mixture is obtained [16]. Line two 8" (20 cm) springforms with parchment paper. Pour the milk dough into one [17] and the chocolate one into the other [18].
Bake in a static oven at 355°F (180°C) for 45 minutes. Do the toothpick test to make sure they are cooked and take them out of the oven [19] [20]. Let them cool then turn them upside down on a wire rack and let them cool completely.
