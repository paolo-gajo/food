If you’re looking for something hearty and substantial for a family dinner or an informal evening with friends, baked sausage and potatoes are sure to hit the spot! This rustic main course may not be the height of elegance or sophistication, but it certainly satisfies the palate with its perfect combination of rich flavors. We’re already sold on the sausage and potato combination. In this very simple, down-to-earth recipe, the irresistibly intense flavor of luganega sausage, enhanced by the roasting process, brings to mind the unmistakable fragrance of food slow-cooked over embers. The recipe is faithful to the no-nonsense, no-frills cuisine typical in northern Italy, but also the method of slow cooking in sauce more commonly found in the south. The potatoes delicately balance out the flavors with their neutral yet hearty taste. All you need at this point is a little rosemary to add aroma! Dinner is served, just make sure you manage to snag the last sausage.
