To prepare the baked sausage and potatoes, start with the potatoes. First peel the potatoes, then cut into slices [1] and then into cubes, making sure they’re all the same size (2-3).
Transfer them to a baking sheet [4] and season with salt, pepper, oil [5], and oregano [6]. Mix the potatoes to ensure they’re uniformly seasoned.
Now cut the sausages into pieces about 2-3 inches (6-7 cm) long [7] and arrange them on top of the potatoes [8]. Mash the peeled tomatoes in a small bowl and pour them onto the baking sheet, mixing everything together [9].
Season with the rosemary needles (10-11) and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 30-35 minutes. You can open the oven and stir from time to time to ensure the dish cooks evenly. Once cooked [12], serve the baked sausage and potatoes while still hot.
