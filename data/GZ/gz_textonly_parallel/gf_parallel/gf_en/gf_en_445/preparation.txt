To make the Danubio salato, start by preparing the dough in a bowl. Pour the flour, the crambled yeast [1] and add sugar [2], salt and an egg [3].
Finally pour the milk [4] and start kneading with a fork to mix the ingredients. As soon as the mixture begins to develop a consistency, remove the fork and use your hands and add a dash of oil [5]. When it starts to harden, move the dough to the work surface [6].
Work it with your hands until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. Form a ball, [7] place it into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap [8] and let it rise for at least 3 hours. You can place the dough to rise in the oven while off, with the light on. Once the leavening time has elapsed, the dough will have doubled in volume [9].
In the meantime, chop the baked ham [10] and dice the cheese [11]. Divide the dough in half [12].
Take a half and roll it up to make a sausageshape [13]. Make 10 equal pieces [14]. In total you will have to create 20. Take each piece of dough, flatten it slightly and stuff it with the ham and cheese [15].
Seal the flaps (16-17) and form a small ball [18].
Oil an 11-inch (28 cm) diameter baking tray [19], place the balls [20] with the sealed part facing downwards and arranged in a radial pattern along the entire perimeter. Cover with plastic wrap [21] and let rise again for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, preheat the oven to 355° F (180° C) in static mode. Mix the yolk with milk [22] to brush the leavened balls [23] and cook them for about 30 minutes in the central part of the oven. At the end of cooking, remove from the oven and serve warm [24].
