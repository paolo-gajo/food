To prepare gnocchi with stracchino cheese and spinach, start by preparing the potato gnocchi. Boil the potatoes for around 30-40 minutes from when the water starts to boil, depending on how big they are, and pierce with a fork, which should slide in easily if they are done; drain when ready. Skin them while hot and mash them using a potato masher, then place the puree on the flour you will have already placed on the pastry board [2]. Now add the egg [3] and a pinch of salt.
Knead by hand [4] to obtain a soft but firm dough [5]. Take a part of the dough and roll it into 0.8 inch (2 cm) thick strips with your fingertips [6]. In the meantime, cover the remaining dough with a cloth so that it does not dry out.
Cut the strips into slices [7], take each piece and lightly press it against a gnocchi shaper with your thumb to make the classic shape [8]. If you don not have a gnocchi shaper, you can use a fork and drag it over the prongs. Leave the gnocchi to one side and start preparing the sauce Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan [9], 
add the previously washed spinach [10], cover with the lid [11] and leave to sweat for 10 minutes on a low flame; stir occasionally. In the meantime, bring a saucepan filled with water to the boil, which you'll need for cooking the gnocchi in. Once the spinach is cooked [12],
place them on a cutting board, be careful not to burn yourself; leave them to cool slightly before finely chopping them with a knife [13], then leave them to one side. Place the fresh liquid cream in the same pan you used to cook the spinach, along with the coarsely chopped stracchino cheese [14]. Heat on a medium flame so that the cheese melts to form a cream [15].
Now add the finely chopped spinach and stir [16]. Cook the gnocchi for a few minutes [17] in the simmering water (so that they don't break up); they are ready as soon as they come to the surface. Drain with a skimmer, place them directly in the sauce [18]
and stir delicately to flavor them [19]. Serve gnocchi with stracchino cheese and spinach nice and not, add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano [20] and pepper to taste. The gnocchi are ready to be enjoyed [21]!
