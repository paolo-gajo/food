To cook the pumpkin and Gorgonzola risotto, start by preparing the vegetable broth for cooking the rice, and wash, peel, and cut the vegetables into chunks. Place them in a pot, along with the water, parsley, and salt [1]. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, and cook for around 1 hour. When the broth is ready, strain it through a sieve  [2] and keep it warm [3].
Next, turn your attention to the pumpkin, removing the skin, seeds, and pulp inside, cutting it into thin slices [4], and then dicing it [5]. Finely chop the onion [6].
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onion [7], and brown on very low heat for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally [8]. Once the onion is soft and transparent, add the diced pumpkin [9].
Stir well and simmer with the hot broth [10]. Cook the pumpkin, stirring frequently and adding more broth as needed. This will take around 20 minutes [11]. In the meantime, toast the rice separately (the moisture created by the pumpkin in the pan would prevent the grains from sealing properly): heat a large frying pan on high heat and pour in the unwashed rice [12].
Toast the rice for a few minutes, stirring frequently so that it doesn't burn, then simmer with the white wine [13] and stir immediately so that it doesn't stick. Next, transfer it to the pan containing the pumpkin [14] and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring continuously [15].
Start adding the broth, a ladle at a time [16], adding the next only once the previous one has been absorbed. Continue doing this, stirring frequently, until the rice is cooked according to the time stated on the packaging. When the rice is nearly cooked, season with salt and pepper to taste [17]. Turn off the heat and cream the risotto with the butter [18].
Add the Gorgonzola [19] and mix thoroughly [20] (you can add a little more broth at this stage if youwant to achieve a creamier risotto, known as "all’onda"). You can also put the lid back on the pan for a few moments to help the cheese to melt. Plate up, and garnish with a few pieces of fresh rosemary [21]. Your pumpkin and Gorgonzola risotto is ready to be served!
