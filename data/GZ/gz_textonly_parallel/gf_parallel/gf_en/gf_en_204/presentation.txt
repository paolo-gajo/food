The orangey sweetness of pumpkin is one of the most hotly anticipated pleasures of fall. This versatile ingredient, featured in a whole host of sweet and savory recipes, keeps us company through the cold winter months, bringing a touch of color to our dishes and warming our hearts at the same time. While pumpkin risotto may be one of the best-loved classics of Italian cuisine, this pumpkin and Gorgonzola risotto is every bit as worthy of a place in the Italian culinary tradition. The rich, creamy, melting flavor of Gorgonzola, a soft blue cheese typical of northern Italy, envelopes the pumpkin in an irresistible embrace, leaving the rice, artfully toasted, softened, and creamed as the risotto tradition dictates, to do the rest. The result? A creamy, tasty first course thatâ€™s great for family dinners and special occasions alike and is sure to win everyone over at the first bite, delighting the palate with a whole host of flavors that really showcase the true magic of fall... and of good food!
