To prepare the rustic four-cheese pie, start by thinly slicing the scamorza [1] and Gruyère cheeses [2] and then dicing the Gorgonzola piccante [3].
Chop the sage leaves and remove the thyme leaves from the stem [4]. Now get started on your savory pie. Unroll the puff pastry into an 11-inch (28-cm) dish [5] and layer two-thirds of the sliced scamorza cheese [6],
followed by a few slices of cooked ham [7], slices of Gruyère [8], and more ham. Then add the Gorgonzola cubes [9]
and the remaining scamorza cheese [10]. Fold in the edges of the pastry [11]. Lastly, sprinkle over the herbs [12]
and grated Parmigiano cheese[13]. Now your rustic four-cheese pie is ready to bake in a preheated conventional oven at 350°F (180°C) for about 20 minutes [14], followed by another 2-3 minutes broiling at maximum power: Enjoy it piping hot [15]!
