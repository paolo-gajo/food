Getting a group of people to agree about food is probably the most difficult thing you can do! Everyone has their own tastes and everyone’s taste buds interpret flavor nuances in a different way. But when our kitchen wizards turned out this rustic four-cheese pie, they knew there’d be no objections from the editorial staff – quite the contrary! We were all intrigued by this four-cheese treat, just like the classic four-cheese pasta. It’s an original way to win everyone over and also to clear out your fridge when you have too much leftover cheese. Try cooking our rustic four-cheese pie yourself and let us know if it brought instant harmony, like what happened here!
