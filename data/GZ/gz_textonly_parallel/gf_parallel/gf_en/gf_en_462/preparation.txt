To make the coffee sorbet, start by preparing the coffee in a moka pot, without adding any sugar. Then, pour the water [1], the coffee you’ve prepared [2], and the granulated sugar [3] into a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring with a whisk.
When the mixture has come to a boil, turn off the heat and pour in the heavy cream [4], always stirring with the whisk, and allow to cool. Next, pour the mixture into a bowl (metal is better) [5] and place in the freezer for around 6 hours. We recommend taking the sorbet out of the freezer every two hours and stirring it with the whisk [6]. 
After these steps, you’ll get the compact consistency typical of sorbet [7]; however, since not all freezers are the same, if it’s still too soft, we advise leaving the sorbet in the freezer for longer. Once it’s ready, store the sorbet in the freezer and pour the heavy cream for the garnish into a bowl [8] and whip it to stiff peaks using a hand mixer [9].
Take some dessert glasses and fill them with the coffee sorbet using a spoon [10], then garnish with a dollop of whipped cream [11] and a sprinkling of cocoa powder [12]. The coffee sorbet is ready to go!
