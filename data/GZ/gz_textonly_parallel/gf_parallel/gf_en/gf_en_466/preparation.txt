To prepare cod fritters, start with cleaning the cod. Make sure your cod has already been desalted, otherwise you can do it yourself. At this point, remove the skin from the fillet, using a very sharp knife and sliding it parallel to the meat [1]. First cut the piece of fish into strips [2] and then cut it into cubes and chop it with a knife [3].
Once coarsely chopped, transfer it to a small bowl and add marjoram leaves [4]. In another bowl, sift the two flours together [5] and add the brewer's yeast [6].
Pour iced water slowly and whisk [7], until you get a smooth and homogeneous batter [8]. Add the cod and mix everything [9].
Add ground black pepper [10] and a pinch of salt if necessary. Wrap with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes in a cool place. Then, heat the oil for frying in a large pan until it reaches a temperature of 345°F (175°C). You can measure the temperature with a kitchen thermometer. Once the oil is hot, create some balls with the mixture [12]
and dip them in the boiling oil [13]. Fry few pieces at a time for about 6-7 minutes, turning them often. When they turn golden brown [14], drain them on a tray lined with absorbent paper [15]. Continue frying until the dough is finished and serve your cod fritters still hot!
