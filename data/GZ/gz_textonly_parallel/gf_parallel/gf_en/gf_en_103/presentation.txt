The best Mediterranean recipes are made with simple ingredients, in this case the same as pizza marinara... We are talking about the steak pizzaiola, a great classic of Italian cuisine! Steaks of veal or beef are dipped in a delicios tomato sauce dresses with garlic and oregano. But do not forget to beat the meat to make it tender and tasty. This way it will only need a few minutes to cook! A quick and easy second course, ideal to prepare for young and old, even for a last minute dinner. You just have to make a choice ... will you use the remaining pizzaiola sauce to season some pasta or will you eat it with one or two slices of homemade bread?
