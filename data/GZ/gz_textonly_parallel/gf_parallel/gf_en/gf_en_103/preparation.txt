To prepare the steak pizzaiola, start with the sauce: heat the oil in a pan and add the crushed garlic cloves [1]. After a couple of minutes, pour the tomato puree [2] and a drop of water used to rinse the jar [3]. Simmer for about 15 minutes over low heat.
In the meantime, prepare the meat: make small cuts on the edges of the slices where there is some fat to prevent them from curling during cooking [4], then transfer the slices on a sheet of parchment paper [5]. Cover with another sheet and beat them lightly, being careful not to tear the meat; you will need to obtain a uniform thickness of about 3-4 mm [6].
When the sauce has reduced, flavor with oregano [7], salt [8] and pepper, then remove the garlic [9].
Dip the slices of meat in the sauce (if they are too big you can cut them in half) [10] and let them cook 2 minutes per side [11]. Garnish with a few basil leaves, if you wish, and immediately serve your steak pizzaiola [12]!
