To prepare your ricotta castagnole, start by draining the excess whey from this cheese. Simply place the ricotta in a sieve and leave to drain for 2 hours inside a container (best kept in the refrigerator!). Now sieve it and pour it into a container [1] together with the egg and sugar [2], stir vigorously to mix all the ingredients together. Grate the zest of one previously washed and dried orange [3]
and stir some more. Then add the previously sieved flour and baking powder [4], one spoon at a time to prevent the formation of lumps; stir with a spatula. After adding all the flour you will notice that the resulting dough is soft and sticky [5], so to form balls that are around 0.5 oz (15 g) each, be sure to flour your hands regularly [6].
With these amounts, you should be able to make around 30 castagnole [7]. Add abundant peanut oil to a pan and as soon as it reaches a temperature of 340°F (170°C - check using a kitchen thermometer), add a few fritters at a time [8] so that the temperature does not drop too much and the castagnole do not absorb too much oil. After 3-4 minutes, they will be golden and ready to be drained [9].
As you finish cooking them place them on absorbent kitchen paper [10]. Now your ricotta castagnole are ready to be sprinkled with icing sugar [11]. Now all you need to do is enjoy them [12]!
