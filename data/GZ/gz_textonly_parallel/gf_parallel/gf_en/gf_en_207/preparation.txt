To prepare the prawn guazzetto, start by cleaning the prawn: Remove only their outer shell [1] and take out the dark vein (the digestive tract) by pulling gently with the blade of a knife or toothpick [2]. Leave the head and tail attached and place the prawn on a tray [3].
Take the fresh chili pepper, remove the inner seeds, and cut it into thin strips [4]. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add a whole peeled clove of garlic [5] and the sliced chili pepper [6].
When the oil is hot, place the prawns in the pan alongside one other without overlapping [7], brown on both sides for a minute, then douse with the brandy [8]. Tilt the pan so that the liqueur catches fire and let it flamb√© until the flame goes out on its own. Add the peeled cherry tomatoes [9] 
and dilute the sauce with water [10]. Season with salt, cover with a lid [11], and continue cooking for about 4-5 minutes. Using tongs, remove the garlic clove [12], then crush some of the cherry tomatoes with a fork and continue cooking the prawns for another 10 minutes.
Wash, dry, and finely chop the parsley [13]. Once cooked, turn off the heat, garnish the prawns with the parsley [14] and serve the dish piping hot [15].
