To prepare stuffed meatloaf, start by making the mixture. Place the minced meat in a bowl, add the egg [1] and the Parmigiano [2], the salt and pepper. Mix by hand [3] to obtain a uniform mixture.
Now take some parchment paper and arrange the bacon slices into 2 rows on it, slightly overlapping (4-5). Remove the mixture from the bowl and spread it over the bacon layer [6]
and press down until around 0.5" (1.5 cm) thick. Leave free the edge of the shorter sides [7]. Now tidily arrange the ham [8] and Edam cheese slices [9]
and spread the spinach over it too [10]. Use the parchment paper to roll the meat up [11] and make sure the pancetta bacon does not peel away from the parchment paper [12].
Now that you have shaped it into a large sausage [13], finish preparing the stuffed polpettone by rolling it up using the parchment paper, making sure that it is fully wrapped in the slices of bacon (14-15).
Place the stuffed polpettone on a baking tray with parchment paper [16]; bake in a static oven preheated to 392°F (200°C) for around 40 minutes on the middle shelf. Remove from the oven [17], leave to cool slightly and serve your stuffed polpettone in slices [18]!
