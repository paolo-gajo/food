Sometimes a little goes a long way in transforming a simple dish, like meatloaf! This is how all versions of this delicious dish are created, including with chicken, eggplants, filled with scamorza cheese or spinach. In the kitchen each chef has their own secret to creating something unique, but the one we present you with today is not so much a secret as an invaluable hack that will amaze everyone! MeatloafÂ wrapped in pancetta bacon will be a truly appetizing second course, filled with ham, cheese and lots of spinach: everyone will love it! Bring it to the table still whole and only slice before serving, still piping hot: thanks to the melted cheese and crispy bacon, your guests will enjoy a truly mouth-watering experience and will look forward to their first bite!?
