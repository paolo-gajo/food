To make fennel au gratin, clean and tip the fennel, remove the base [1] and outermost, tougher leaves; cut each one in half and wash under running water, then cut into large slices [2]. Plunge the fennel in abundant hot salted water [3] and blanch them for 5-6 minutes.
In a capacious pan melt 1 stick of butter on a low flame, drain the fennel thoroughly and once the butter has melted, add the vegetables to the pan to brown for another 5 minutes, turning them over occasionally so that a crust forms on both sides [5]. Remove from the heat when done, and start preparing the bechamel. Heat the milk in a saucepan [6],
in another saucepan melt the butter [7] and gradually sprinkle in the sieved flour[8], stirring all the while with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming [9].
Now add the previously heated milk [10] and continue to stir until the sauce thickens; add the salt and the nutmeg [11]. Now take the previously browned fennel slices and place them on the bottom of a round baking tray that is big enough for the vegetables to be arranged in a single layer; we used a 10 inch tray. Arrange them in a circle along the edge and work your way towards the center [12].
Pour the bechamel over them [13], sprinkle with the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [14] and bake in a static oven preheated to 392? for around 20-25 minutes (or in a ventilated oven at 356°F (180°C) for 15-20 minutes), until a golden crust forms on the surface. Remove the fennel au gratin from the oven [15], leave to cool and then serve.
