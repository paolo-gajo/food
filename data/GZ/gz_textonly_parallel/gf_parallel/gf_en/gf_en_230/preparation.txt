To prepare pizza tongues, start with the poolish: place the manitoba wheat, water [1] and the crumbled yeast in a bowl [2]. Stir with a fork or spatula [3] for just enough time to amalgamate the ingredients.
Cover with plastic wrap [4] and leave the poolish at room temperature for 12 hours. Once this time is up [5], place the poolish in a bigger bowl [6].
Add the water [7], the crumbled yeast [8] and stir with a spatula [9].
Now add both the flours [10] and stir once more with a spatula [11]. Once you have created a homogeneous mixture, add the malt [12],
the oil [13], the salt [14] and knead by hand [15].
Place it on a work top [16] and without adding any flour, knead for ten minutes or so [17], until smooth. If too sticky, leave the dough to rest for a few minutes before kneading [17]. Roll the dough into a ball [18]
and move it to a lightly greased and capacious bowl, possibly wooden. Cover with plastic wrap [19] and leave to leaven for 3 hours at room temperature. Once the dough is nice and leavened [20], place it on a pastry board [21].
Divide it into 4 portions, each 7 oz (200 g), using a spatula [22]. Round each piece, using a dash of flour [23]. Cover with a cloth and leave to rest for 30 minutes [24].
Once this time is up, press down on the dough balls [25] and delicately spread them into strips, by hand [26]. If they shrink, leave them to rest for a little while longer, covered with the cloth. Now place the peeled tomatoes in a bowl and press them with the back of a fork [27].
Add salt and oil for flavor [28]. Place the first pizza strip onto an oven tray: if big enough, you can bake a couple of strips at the same time, but bear in mind that they will grow during baking. Use a spoon [29] to spread the tomato over the pizza strip, but leave a space around the edge [30]. Bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 410°F(210°C), for 15 minutes.
Now remove the pizza strips from the oven [31] and add the gorgonzola cheese using a knife [32].
Bake for another 5 minutes, once more at the temperature indicated, until the cheese has melted. Now remove from the oven [34], add the prosciutto crudo [35] and serve your pizza tongs [36].
