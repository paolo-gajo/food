Do you remember our baked feta recipe? It is so delicious and captivating that we decided to turn it into a sauce for a first course: baked feta pasta! Mediterranean flavors have always been a source of inspiration and feta, borrowed from Greek cuisine, seemed the natural choice, paired with sweet cherry tomatoes and our very own taggiasca olives, for a tasty match made in heaven that will win you over as soon as you take your first bite.
