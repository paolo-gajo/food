To prepare baked feta pasta, place the whole feta on a tray [1], then add the washed and dried tomatoes [2], seasoned with the fresh basil leaves [3].
Drizzle with olive oil [4] and season with black pepper [5]. Bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 392° for 25 minutes. In the meantime, bring some water to the boil in a pan, add salt and cook the pasta until firm to the bite [6].
In the meantime, remove the tray from the oven [7], then drain the pasta [8] and add the pitted olives [9].
Stir to amalgamate the flavors [10] and crumble the feta. Finish by garnishing with dried oregano to taste [11]. Serve the baked feta pasta right away [12].
