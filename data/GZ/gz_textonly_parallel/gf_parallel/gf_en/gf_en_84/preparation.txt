To make these stuffed zucchini swirls, start by washing and tipping the zucchini. Use a mandolin to cut them into slices lengthwise, around 5/32"-13/64" mm thick [1]. You'll need 36 slices of zucchini. Cut the cheese into slices that are the same width as the zucchini slices [2]. Now take a slice of zucchini and lay it over 2 slices of cheese [3].
You'll need to cover the entire surface [4]. Add a slice of ham [5] and top with another slice of zucchini [6]. 
Roll it up [7] and spear with 2 toothpicks to hold it in place [8]. Once you have finished rolling up all the zucchini slices with a cheese and ham filling, you will have 18 swirls [9]. 
Heat the seed oil for frying. In the meantime, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dip the swirls in the egg [19] and then coat with breadcrumbs [11]. Fry 2-3 swirls at a time in the oil at a temperature of 340°F, for around 4-5 minutes [12]. 
Drain [13] on absorbent paper towel [14]. Your stuffed zucchini swirls are ready to serve [15].
