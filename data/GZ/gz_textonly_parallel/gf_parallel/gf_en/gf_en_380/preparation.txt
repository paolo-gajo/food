To make hot milk sponge cake, break the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt [1] and whisk. With the mixer on, gradually add sugar, to ease its blending into the mixture [2]. When the mixture is light and frothy, about 10 minutes later, turn off the mixer [3].
Place a strainer over the bowl and sieve the flour and baking powder, adding them gradually while stirring with the spatula from bottom to top [4], to blend them in without deflating the mixture [5]. Take a couple of spoonfuls of dough and set them aside in another bowl [6].
Heat the milk in a pan over medium heat, then add the butter [7]: let it melt completely and bring almost to a boil, then turn off the heat and pour the mixture into the container with the spoonfuls of dough you had set aside [8]. Mix well with a wire whisk to get a sort of batter [9].
Now pour the batter into the larger bowl with the rest of the dough [10], stir gently with a spatula and finally grate the lemon zest [11]. Butter and flour an 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pan and fill it with the batter.
Cook in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) on the lower rack (not touching the base) for about 35 minutes. After the first 25 minutes, transfer the pan to the center rack and continue for the remaining 10 minutes. As soon as the cake is ready (check with a toothpick that it is cooked also inside, otherwise continue baking), take it out of the oven and let it cool down [13], then take it out of the pan and place it on a cake rack to cool completely [14]. Your hot milk sponge cake is ready to be enjoyed [15]!
