Are you ready to get your hands dirty alongside Neapolitan Chef Roberto Di Pinto as you try out our recipe for casatiello, Neapolitan stuffed bread, the Neapolitan delicacy par excellence? Made using a dough that’s similar to bread dough but flavored with a filling of Neapolitan salami, Pecorino cheese, and a generous sprinkling of pepper, Neapolitan casatiello is a rustic dish that’s very popular at Easter thanks to its rather unique feature: whole fresh eggs enclosed in a ring of dough that children usually fight over at the table on Easter Sunday! Each family has its own tradition, of course, especially when it comes to the filling, but the most important thing is to be generous and not to skimp on the cheese and salami! So, grab the utensils you’ll need to make an extremely tasty Neapolitan casatiello, the most important, of course, being your hands... and plenty of love!
