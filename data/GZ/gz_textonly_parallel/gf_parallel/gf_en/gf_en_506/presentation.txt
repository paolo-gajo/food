Today we present you with the perfect dessert for those warm autumn evenings, a time for Halloween recipes, pumpkins and ... chestnuts. Chestnut and chocolate cake, oh so soft and aromatic, is a favorite for those who love to treat themselves to something sweet while they sip a piping hot cup of tea. Lovers of more'ish experiences can even accompany a generous slice of this cake with some delicate custard. The rustic flavor of the chestnut and chocolate cake, filled with sweet notes pleasantly contrasted by the presence of cocoa, make it the perfect dessert at the end of a delicate meal. Prepare it with us!
