To prepare the chestnut and chocolate cake, make sure that all ingredients are at room temperature. Place the eggs in a planetary mixer, followed by the sugar [1] and the seeds from one vanilla pod [2]. Whisk for around ten minutes or until the mixture becomes light colored and frothy (if you do not have a planetary mixer you can use an electric whisk) [3].
In the meantime, sieve the chestnut flour [4], baking powder [5] and cocoa [6] in a bowl.
Now add the milk, at room temperature, and whisk gently [7]: be sure to avoid the formation of lumps [8]. Now add some of the egg and sugar mix to this dough [9],
to soften and temper the mixture [10]. Add the remaining part [11] and gently mix so that the eggs do not deflate. Fold in with the spatula, from the bottom up. Butter and line a 9" (22 cm) diameter cake mold with baking paper. Pour the mixture into the mold [12]
and bake in a static oven preheated to 340°F (170°C), for 70 minutes, on the lowest rack [13]. Check that it is done by performing the toothpick test. Remove from the oven and leave to cool before removing the cake from the mold and serving [14]. If you prefer, sprinkle a pinch of icing sugar over your chestnut and chocolate cake [15]!
