Only two simple ingredients, such as water and flour, can turn into something truly extraordinary. Also called sourdough, or sourdough starter, this compound is fed regularly to magically allow your baked goods, both sweet and savory, to rise slowly and in the right way. But before entering this immense world you must ask yourself if you are willing to dedicate your time to yeast, in fact only with the right "pampering" and without being in a rush will you be able to give life to this wonderful transformation. Once this is established, together with chef Gabriele Bonci you will learn all the secrets and the best techniques! The stiff starter allows you to get the best results in longer and more complex leavening (as in the case of the panettone or colomba) and it also needs more care, but before you start, take a look at liquid starterâ€¦ it could be your thing! At this point you are ready to indulge yourself and put your hands in the dough to churn out a nice focaccia or pizza, for a more fragrant and digestible result than those made with instant yeast!
