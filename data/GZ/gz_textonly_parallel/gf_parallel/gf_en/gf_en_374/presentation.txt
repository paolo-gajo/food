Here is one of the cornerstones typical of Roman cuisine, a delicacy of regulars at the most famous taverns and restaurants in the center and the capital's jewish ghetto neighborhood. It is preceded only by the tough choice between carbonara, gricia and amatriciana. Jewish-style rtichokes is a delicious vegetable recipe for enjoying fried artichoke, often mistaken for another, equally delicious fried preparation: artichokes Roman style, which is cooked in a saucepan. The leaves are plucked off by hand and are as crunchy as chips. Everyone has their own technique for making Jewish-style rtichokes and we present you with our own version, which obviously involves frying some nicely plump purple artichokes!
