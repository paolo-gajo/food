To make potato calzoni, boil the unpeeled potatoes until soft [1]. Mash the potatoes while still hot using a potato masher, then place the puree in a large bowl [2]. Add the potato starch and instant baking powder[3].
Now add an egg [4] and amalgamate the ingredients [5]. Flavor with the salt and pepper and knead by hand until smooth and even. Lastly, add the oil [6].
Let the dough absorb the oil [7], then leave to one side. Add a drizzle of oil to a large pan, followed by the previously washed spinach [9].
Add salt and flavor with the dry peperoncino [10]. Stir and cook on a medium flame for around 10 minutes. When cooked [11], place the spinach in a baking tray and leave to cool [12].
Roll the potato dough out on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with potato starch [13], until around 0.2 inches (1/2 cm) thick [14]. Use a 4.3 inch (10 cm) diameter shaping ring mold to cut out 6 discs [15].
Fill half of the discs with the lukewarm spinach and grated pulled curd cheese [17]. Fold each disc over and close to form a crescent shaped bundle [18]. Press down lightly along the edge to seal thoroughly.
Fill the remaining discs with the diced mozzarella [19] and the prosciutto cotto [20]. Close to form a crescent shape and seal thoroughly [21].
Heat abundant oil in a large pan (cover the bottom with around 0.4 inches (1 cm) of oil). Once hot, place the bundles in the pan [23] and cook for around 10 minutes; turn them over to check they are golden [24].
Drain the calzoni [25] and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper [26]. Serve the potato calzoni nice and hot [27]!
