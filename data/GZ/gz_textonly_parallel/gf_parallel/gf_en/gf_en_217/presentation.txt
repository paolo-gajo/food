Potato calzoniÂ is a morish starter inspired by fried panzerotti: they are similar in shape but smaller, with a difference in the dough. They are made with boiled potatoes, perhaps those left over from last night's dinner, or from making gnocchi! These bundles contain two appetizing fillings: spinach and provola cheese, prosciutto and cheese! Let your imagination inspire interesting pairings for your fillings! You won't need to know how to store potato calzoni...there won't be any left over!
