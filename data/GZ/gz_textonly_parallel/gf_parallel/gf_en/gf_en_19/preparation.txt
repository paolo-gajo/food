Yogomisù, start by placing the brown sugar in a saucepan [1]; add the water [2] and bring to the boil without stirring at all. Once the sugar has fully dissolved, add the berries [3]
and cook for around 5 minutes [4]. Now place them in a mixer glass and blend [5] into a cream. Place the puree in a baking tray [6] and leave to one side.
Now prepare the cream. Start by whipping the thoroughly chilled cream, slowly adding the powdered sugar (7-8). Place the yogurt in a bowl [9]
and gradually add the cream [10], stirring from the bottom up [11]. Now compose your glasses. Take one of the ladyfingers and break it in half [12].
Dip both pieces in the berry fruit puree [13] and turn them over using a fork, so that you cover both sides. Take one of the small jars and add a layer of cream [14]. Add both ladyfinger pieces [15]
and a little puree [16]. Repeat with the other layer: add a spoon of cream [17] and then two ladyfinger pieces, followed by the puree [18]
and finish with another spoon of cream [19]. Crumble the dried raspberries into a powder and use it to garnish the surface of the yogomisù [20]. Finish with the berries and mint leaves [21], and repeat for the other 3 jars. Place back in the refrigerator and leave to firm up for at least 1 hour before serving your yogomisù!
