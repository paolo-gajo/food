Time for lunch and still don’t know what to make? No problem! Pasta alla cenere (pasta with Gorgonzola and black olive sauce) to the rescue! This is a first-course dish that’s ready in a snap, in less than 20 minutes even, and gives a classic first course such as pasta with Gorgonzola cheese a tasty black olive twist. The addition of homemade black olive pâté not only gives the dish a special flavor, it also gives it a unique look. The specks of olive look just like cenere, or cinders, giving the recipe its name. Pasta alla cenere makes the perfect option for lunch or a last-minute dinner with friends. Get everyone to try it – they’ll love it!
