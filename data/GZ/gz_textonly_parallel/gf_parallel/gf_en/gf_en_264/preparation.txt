To make pasta with broccoli, start by removing the broccoli florets from the middle stalk [1]; cut them in half if they are very big. Rinse them under running water. Bring some salted water to the boil in a saucepan [2] and add the broccoli as soon as the water starts to boil [3].
Cook for around ten minutes [4]. In the meantime, brown a garlic clove in a drizzle of oil, in a deep pan [5]. Drain the broccoli and place in a saucepan, save the cooking water for later [6]. 
Leave a few whole florets to one side [7], which you will then add to the finished pasta dish. Add a little water to the broccoli [8]. Add salt and pepper, then cook on a medium-low flame for around 20 minutes, or at least until cooked and a cream starts to form. Add some more water if necessary. Once cooked, remove the garlic clove [9].
Cook the troccoli until firm to the bite in the same water used to boil the broccoli: bring the water back to the boil [10] and follow cooking times indicated on the package. Add the broccoli left to one side to the sauce [11]. Drain the pasta and add to the broccoli cream [12].
Add a ladle of cooking water, depending on how creamy the sauce is [13]. Sauté the pasta with the broccoli for a few moments [14] and serve nice and hot [15]; add pepper to taste. Your pasta with broccoli is ready, buon appetito.
