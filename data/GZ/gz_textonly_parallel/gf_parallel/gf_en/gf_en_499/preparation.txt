To prepare chicken drumsticks with mustard and bacon, wash and dry the chicken drumsticks thoroughly. Remove the skin, pulling it gently towards the thinner end [1]. Make four clean evenly-shaped cuts on each rumsticks [2], then brush the surface with mustard [3] ensuring it gets into the cuts and spreading it evenly. If you prefer, you can also rub the mustard on the chicken drumsticks with your hands.
Wrap two slices of bacon around each drumstick, covering them completely [4] [5]. Next, arrange them neatly in the pan [6].
Sprinkle them with oil [7] and season with the halved garlic [8] and the broken up rosemary sprigs [9].
Add the sage leaves [10]. Then salt [11] and pepper [12] to taste.
Finally pour the wine over the chicken [13]: the baking pan is now ready to be placed in the oven. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 50 minutes [14]. Check the cooking of your drumsticks from time to time because it will depend on the size of the legs themselves. While the legs are roasting, collect the liquid released from the meat a few times and pour it over the top to prevent it from drying out. Once cooked, remove your chicken drumsticks with mustard and bacon from the oven [15] and enjoy them nice and hot!
