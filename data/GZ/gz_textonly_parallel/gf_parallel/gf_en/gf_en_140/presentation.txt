Sicilian buns (brioche col tuppo) are the pride and joy of Sicilian patisserie. Soft and delicious, they are enjoyed everywhere on the island, generally served with another typical delicacy, granita, although they also come filled with ice cream. The name of these buns comes from their shape, similar to the traditional low bun once typically worn by Sicilian women, called a "tuppo" in regional dialect. Originally brioches col tuppo were prepared with lard, but the ingredient has since been replaced by butter, for a sweeter and more delicate flavor.
