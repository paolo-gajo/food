To prepare Sicilian buns, start by making the dough. Place the milk in a small jug, add the cake yeast [1] and stir to dissolve [2]. Place both flours in a bowl [3],
add the yeast dissolved in the milk [4] and start kneading by hand [5]. Place the dough on a work top and continue kneading until compact [6]: this will be your dough.
Place it in a bowl, cover in plastic wrap [7] and leave in the refrigerator for around 12 hours. During this time it should double in volume [8]. Place both flours in the bowl of a planetary mixer fitted with a hook [9].
Add the dough, breaking it up into pieces by hand [10] and start mixing [11]. Dissolve the cake yeast in the milk [12]
and add it to the planetary mixer bowl [13]. Add the sugar and mix for a few minutes [14]. Now add the eggs one at a time [15] and continue mixing until fully absorbed.
Add the salt [16] and soft butter, gradually [17]. Knead for around 15 minutes to obtain a smooth, soft and very elastic dough [18].
Place it in a bowl [19], it will be very moist and soft. You'll still be able to fold it [20]. Cover with a cloth [21] and wait for around 10 minutes before folding and resting, twice more. Lastly, cover with plastic wrap and leave to leaven for 2 hours at room temperature.
Once this time is up, the dough will have leavened [22]. Place it on a work top lightly sprinkled with flour [23] and divide it into 10 x 2.8 oz (80 g) pieces and 10 x 0.5 oz (15 g) pieces [24].
Roll the larger pieces into balls [25] and arrange them onto two trays lined with parchment paper, be sure to leave enough space between each one [26]. Now shape the smaller pieces and arrange them on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour [27]. Wait for 15 minutes.
Now you can shape the brioches. Take the larger ball of dough and press down in the middle with three fingers [28]. Now position the smaller ball inside [29]. Repeat this operation for each bun.
Now beat the yolk and milk together in a bowl [32]. Brush the mix onto the brioches [32]. Leave to leaven for another 30 minutes at room temperature and bake in a static oven preheated to 356°F (180°C) for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven [33] and enjoy your Sicilian buns!
