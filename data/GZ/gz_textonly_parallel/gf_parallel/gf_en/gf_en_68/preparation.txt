To prepare the tasty chicken salad, start by beating the chicken slices with a meat tenderizer [1], between two sheets of baking paper to break down the fibers of the meat without tearing it. Then cook on a hot grill [2] and turn only when the meat is completely white and has the typical grill marks [3]. Then turn and add a pinch of salt to the cooked part. Meanwhile, cook the other side for the same amount of time. It will take about two minutes, but the time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken fillets, so avoid poking the meat with a fork or the juices will come out and the chicken will be too dry. When the meat is well cooked, remove it from the grill and season it with salt immediately, to allow the heat to melt the salt. Place the chicken breasts on a plate and let them cool.
In the meantime, clean the vegetables: take the pepper and remove the inner seeds, then julienne it [4], peel and trim the carrots and cut them into strips too [5]. Slice the celery ribs [6],
pickles [7], and pitted green olives [8] crosswise. And finally cut the cheese (Gruyere or Edam cheese) into sticks [9].
In the meantime the meat will have cooled down, cut it into strips [10] and prepare the dressing: put the mayonnaise in a bowl, add the mustard [11], white wine vinegar [12], salt and pepper.
Finally, pour in the olive oil, mix the ingredients [13] and set aside [14]. Now take a large bowl, add the chicken and all the previously cut ingredients: peppers [15],
celery [16], carrots, pickles, cheese, olives [17] and stir [18].
Then add the dressing [19], stir again and cover with plastic wrap [20]; let it rest in the fridge for at least an hour. After this time the flavors will have blended thoroughly and you can enjoy your tasty chicken salad [21].
