To prepare the meatballs, in a bowl combine the ground beef and pork [1], the egg [2], blended fresh bread crumbs, and chopped parsley [3].
Â 
Season with salt and pepper [4] and thoroughly mix all the ingredients, kneading vigorously [5] to achieve a homogeneous mixture. Let the mixture rest for 30 minutes covered in the fridge. After resting, take the mixture out of the fridge, and with damp hands, take 25 g of the mixture and roll it between your hands to form a round shape. The first meatball is ready [6].
As you shape them, place them on a tray [7]. Heat about an inch of oil in a non-stick pan [8]. The amount of oil should reach halfway up the meatball. When the oil is hot, carefully add the meatballs [9].
Brown the meatballs well on all sides, which will take about 6-7 minutes [10]. At this point, cover with a lid [11] and cook for another 3 minutes, so they cook through to the center. The meatballs are now ready [12].
