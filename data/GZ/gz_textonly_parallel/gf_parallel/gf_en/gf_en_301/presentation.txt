Orecchiette with broccoli rabe, also called "recchitelle" or "strascinati", are one of the most representative typical dishes of Puglia, especially of the province of Bari. This first course is prepared throughout the region, in different versions using vegetables other than broccoli rabe, such as broccoli or tomato sauce. The secret of this dish lies in the optimal cooking of vegetables with pasta, and the experience and knowledge of raw ingredients result in a perfect dish. In keeping with tradition, Chef Fabio Abbattista has cooked them for us making homemade orecchiette with durum wheat semolina, cooked in boiling water together with broccoli rabe to better absorb the aromas, stirred with tasty sautéed anchovies in oil flavored with a clove of garlic. Orecchiette with broccoli rabe is a traditional country dish, simple but with a unique taste that comes from the combination of strong flavors.
