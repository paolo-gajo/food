To prepare the orecchiette pasta, first pour the remilled durum wheat semolina flour on the pastry board, form a fountain [1] and add a pinch of salt to the flour [2]. Pour the water at room temperature in the center [3] 
and start working with your fingers [4] to incorporate the flour. Knead [5] until the dough is smooth and elastic. It'll take about ten minutes. Give the dough a round shape [6] and cover it with a cloth: it should rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
After this time, take a piece of dough, covering the rest with a cloth. Make a roll about 1/3-inch (1 cm) thick (7-8). Using a pastry cutter, cut small pieces about 1/3-inch (1 cm) long [9].
With the help of a butter knife, form small shells by dragging each piece of dough towards you on the pastry board [10]. Then turn the shell back on itself [11]. Continue until you finish all the dough and you will have made your Apulian orecchiette pasta [12].
For the broccoli rabe: clean them by removing the outer leaves and with a small knife (or with your fingers) take only the inner leaves and the flower [13]. Once ready rinse them [14], drain them [15], dry them well, and set them aside. In the meantime, heat a pot with plenty of water, salted to taste, which will be used to boil the broccoli rabe.
In a large skillet pour half of the oil and add the breadcrumbs [16], mix with a rubber spatula and let it toast over medium heat, until golden brown [17], then set aside. As soon as the water has started to boil, cook the previously cleaned broccoli rabe [18] for about 5 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the sauté: in a frying pan pour the remaining oil, an unpeeled crushed garlic clove, and the drained anchovy fillets [19]. Mix with a wooden spatula to dissolve the anchovies in the skillet [20]; it will only take a few minutes for the fried anchovies to flavor the sauté. When ready, remove the garlic [21] and turn off the heat.
After cooking the greens for 5 minutes, add the orecchiette pasta [22] in the same pot and cook for another 5 minutes or so. Mix gently [23], then drain and place the orecchiette pasta and broccoli rabe into the skillet with the sauté [24].
Stir fry briefly and add salt to taste [25]; once ready, turn off the heat [26] and place your orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe on a plate, finishing off with a drizzle of oil and the toasted breadcrumbs [27].
