Pasta and beans (pasta e fagioli) is a classic Italian dish, a first course with an unmistakable flavor that’s deeply rooted in rural tradition. While more rustic versions, like our Neapolitan pasta and beans recipe, involve flavoring the dish with pork rind, other variants combine legumes with mollusks to give the dish an intense flavor of the sea, as in our recipe for cicatielli pasta with mussels and beans. A simple, inexpensive dish, then, but one that’s extremely tasty and authentic nevertheless, just like our own recipe for pasta and beans – thick enough to “stand a spoon up in” (the more traditionalists out there claim that this is how to recognize the right consistency: creamy yet hearty at the same time) and rich in flavor, with the guaranteed savory note that comes courtesy of the lard and prosciutto. A classic and comforting Italian dish that warms the soul and is sure to win everyone over with its timeless flavor. Why not try the summer version using fresh legumes, too?
