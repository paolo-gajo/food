Magic vanilla cake is a surprising cake, both to the taste and sight, which has conquered the web. Its recipe is right off the internet! You may wonder what is magical about a cake with simple ingredients like flour, eggs, sugar and vanilla extract. Relatively quickly, you can prepare a cake that while baking forms three magical layers that will have different consistencies, but the same vanilla taste! The first layer, the one that will be the base, will have a more solid consistency, very similar to that of flan, but with a more intense color. The middle layer will be soft and slightly gelatinous like a pudding, while the final covering will be similar to a soft sponge cake, which you will make even more delicious by sprinkling with powdered sugar. The secret to the success of this dessert is... following a "neat disorder"! You must, in fact, add the ingredients in the sequence and at the indicated temperatures, following the recipe instructions, or the layers will not form correctly. To make this experience even more magical, enjoy your magic vanilla cake with your eyes closed and savor all its parts, delighting in the contrast of its layers and all its goodness!
