To prepare the magic cake, start by melting the butter in a saucepan [1]. Be careful not to let it darken and, once melted, pour it into a bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Then separate the egg whites from the yolks [2] and pour the yolks at room temperature into a bowl, where you will add the sugar [3].
Now with an electric mixer, beat the yolks with sugar for at least 10 minutes, until the mixture becomes clear and frothy [4]. Still beating, add a tablespoon of very cold water [5] and a tablespoon of vanilla extract [6] to the yolks with sugar. If you do not have an electric mixer, or if you prefer, you can use an egg beater or whisk.
Add a pinch of salt [7] and the melted butter that you cooled [8], then continue to beat for a few minutes. Sift the flour, add it to the mixture, a little at a time, and mix until completely absorbed [9]; in the meantime, heat the milk in a saucepan.
Once hot, pour it into the mixture [10] and let it mix for about 1 minute. It is essential that the mixture has no lumps, if it does, you can strain the mixture with a narrow mesh strainer using the back of a spoon to remove the lumps. At this point take the egg whites at room temperature and pour them into a clean bowl, start whipping them with a perfectly clean electric beater [11]. While whipping and when the egg whites have become clear: add the lemon juice (or white wine vinegar) [12] which will give stability to the mixture. You'll need very soft peaks.
Gently beat the egg whites until stiff, so as not to make them droop [13] and mix until a fairly liquid mixture is obtained. Butter a square baking pan measuring 8x8" (20x20 cm) and 2.5" (6 cm) high [14] and line both the bottom and the edges with baking paper [15]. The size of the baking pan is important to obtain the correct thickness of the cake.
 
Then pour the mixture into the buttered and lined baking pan [16] and bake in a static oven preheated to 300° F (150° C) for about 80 minutes, until the surface of the vanilla magic cake is golden brown [17]; take the cake out of the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature, then cover it with a layer of plastic wrap [18] and let it set in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
When the cake has set, remove the baking paper [19] from the baking pan and cut the cake into cubes [20]. To make cutting easier, use a long, smooth-bladed knife wet with water or use a nylon thread. Place the cubes on a serving plate, sprinkle them with powdered sugar [21] and your vanilla magic cake will be ready to be served and enjoyed!
