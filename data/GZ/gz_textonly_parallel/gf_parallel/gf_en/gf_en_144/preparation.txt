To prepare seafood risotto, start by cleaning all the mollusks and crustaceans. Remember to discard any open or broken mussels and clams. Start with the mussels: remove the barnacles with a paring knife [1], followed by the byssus [2]. Lastly, scrape away impurities with a steel scrub and rinse thoroughly [3].
Leave the clams to soak in water [4] with the salt [5] for a couple of hours, the time it takes to purge sand from them; drain and rinse. Remember to tap each clam against the cutting board or sink to check they are whole and not filled with sand [6].
Empty the inside of the calamari and remove the skin [7]. Cut into 0.4 inch strips [8], then into large pieces, each roughly 0.8 inches in size [9].
Lastly, clean the shrimp tails: remove the legs [10] and the shell [11], along with the black string on the back: simply make a small incision on the surface and remove with a knife blade or toothpick [12].
Now that everything is ready, you can move over to the stove. Start by cooking the mussels: heat them in a large pan on a high flame. Put the lid on [13] and leave them to open; shake the pan occasionally. It takes around 2-3 minutes for them to open [14]. Filter the liquid through a colander into a container [15]. 
Wait a few moments before shelling them, to avoid burning yourself. Set aside 2-3 whole mussels for each plate, you'll need them for the final decorative touch [16]. Now cook the clams. Put the pan back on the stove and add the clams. Cover with the lid [17] and leave them to open, shaking the pan occasionally. The bivalves will open in 1-2 minutes; as soon as this happens, filter and add the liquid to the same container used for the mussel liquid [18].
Leave to cool for a few moments before shelling and once more set aside 2-3 whole pieces per plate [19]. Heat the vegetable broth, clean the celery, carrot and fresh spring onion. Finely chop the vegetables with a knife, peel the garlic cloves and leave them whole [20]. Lastly, clean and then finely chop the peperoncino and the parsley. Leave to one side and return to the stove. Heat a saucepan on the stove, add a generous drizzle of oil, followed by the finely chopped garlic and parsley [21].
Leave to flavor for ten minutes or so on a low flame, stirring occasionally. Once the vegetables have softened, remove the garlic, turn up the flame to the maximum setting and add the calamari [23]. Saut? for 1 minute before adding the shrimp tails [24].
Cook for another minute and as soon as the liquid evaporates, add 1.3 oz of white wine, simmer and reduce [25]. Remove from the heat when the alcohol has fully evaporated and place the calamari and shrimps in a bowl; cover with the lid to keep them hot [26]. Add the rice and toast for around 1 minute on the highest setting, stirring all the while to prevent any grains from burning [27].
Once toasted, add the remaining part of the white wine (so 2 oz) [28] and wait for the alcohol to evaporate before cooking the rice with the vegetable squash [29]. You can add the squash gradually by the ladle, until fully cooked. Add the mussel and clam liquid and stir occasionally, but not too much [30].
1-2 minutes before the end of the cooking time, add the shrimps and calamari [31], the mussels and clams [32] and leave to flavor. Remove from the heat, add the very cold and diced butter and stir to obtain a creamy consistency [33].
Add the finely chopped parsley and the freshly ground pepper [34]. Stir and leave to rest for a few minutes before placing on dishes [35]. Your seafood risotto is ready: garnish the dishes with the mussels and clams to set aside for later [36].
