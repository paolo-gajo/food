Carbonara, the Amatriciana and Pasta alla Gricia, like spaghetti cacio e pepe, have by now become dishes that symbolize the Italian spirit, of eating well with “Protected Designation of Origin” ingredients and linked to traditions and territories where they originated. An excellence that moved from the "checkered tablecloths" to great chefs' kitchens. We too want to pay tribute to one of the symbols of good and genuine eating, showing you how to make a perfect cacio e pepe! The secret, in addition to the chemical combination of water and Pecorino proteins to obtain a cream without lumps, lies in the flavor: whole peppercorns crushed the same day and plunged into the pan to toast releasing all their pungent aroma; the pasta whisked slowly and in a controlled way to absorb all the taste of Pecorino romano cheese when you add the cream. Prepare and enjoy: this is another rule to taste the best spaghetti cacio e pepe! Get the forks ready!
