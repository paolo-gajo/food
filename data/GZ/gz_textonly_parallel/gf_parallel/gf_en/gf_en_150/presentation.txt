These savory Halloween pumpkin puffs are small orange-colored cheese puffs decorated with a green stem made of cheese that give them the look of one of the traditional symbols of this spooky holiday! These fun puffs filled with a tasty cream made of fresh cheese and ham are a tempting treat perfect for a Halloween party or nice aperitif with friends. Our savory Halloween pumpkin puffs are made using a Parmesan-flavored choux pastry base thatâ€™s given an orange color and used to make the small puffs.
