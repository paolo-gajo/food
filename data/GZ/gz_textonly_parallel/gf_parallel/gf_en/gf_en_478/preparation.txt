To prepare the chocolate mousse, first chop the dark chocolate [1] and place it a bowl. Move on to the custard sauce. In a non-stick pan, pour the yolks [2], honey [3], 
milk [4] and mix. Put over heat and stir continuously with a soft whisk [5]. Cooking will take place very quickly, you will have to reach 180° F (82° C). We recommend using a kitchen thermometer, as it is very important to reach the exact temperature. As soon as it is cooked, pour in the chocolate [6] 
and stir with the whisk [7] until the chocolate is completely melted [8]. The cream should be shiny. Now mix the cream with a hand blender until it is smooth and shiny [9].
Whip the cream quickly [10]: it should not be stiff, but very soft. Add a little to the chocolate cream [11]  and mix with a whisk to unify the density of the chocolate [12].
Gradually add the remaining whipped cream in 2 more parts [13] by stirring vigorously and making rotating movements from bottom to top. The chocolate mousse is now ready [14], you can divide it among the cups and decorate the top [15] or keep it in the fridge until needed.
