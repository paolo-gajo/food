Chocolate mousse is one of the most classic soft desserts loved by everyone. Its origin is not known exactly, but the only thing that is certain is that it appeared for the first time in French chef Menon’s cookbook Les soupers de la cour in 1755. Chocolate mousse has since conquered the palate of many Italians and others worldwide... is it thanks to the microscopic air bubbles enclosed inside that it is so light and airy? Or is it its sweet, bitter taste that never tires? Probably the combination of the two rendered this mousse so famous. And like all of the most popular recipes, there are many ways to make it, but there are two techniques which are most used, one without eggs and another one which we will provide the recipe for today. Together with Maestro Iginio Massari, we will explain how to make a chocolate mousse starting from a base of custard sauce and adding freshly whipped cream. The result will be an incredible shiny mousse with a velvety, frothy texture. Let your imagination run wild, enjoy the mousse in cups or use it to create a more articulated cake, like our modern cake! And if you love this kind of dessert, try different variants, such as our Avocado Chocolate Mousse!
