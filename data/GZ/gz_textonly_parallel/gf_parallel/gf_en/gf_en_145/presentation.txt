Spaghetti alla carbonara is a classic Roman dish that is well loved throughout Italy, its creamy sauce enveloping the spaghetti providing a real treat for the taste buds. There are some versions inspired by the traditional carbonara, including vegetarian and vegetable versions, but today we’re going to try a seafood one by replacing the guanciale with fish! This seafood carbonara is made with a mix of three tasty varieties of fish: salmon, tuna, and swordfish, all cut into small cubes and sautéed. The result: a rich and creamy dish with an intense aroma that’s guaranteed to be a hit with any fish-loving friends. If you really want to end the meal on a high, you could even use the leftover egg whites to make a soft angel food cake or sweet meringues!
