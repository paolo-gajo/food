To prepare the seafood carbonara, start by heating the water for the pasta and salting it as soon as it comes to a boil. Meanwhile, separate the eggs. Youâ€™ll need 6 yolks [1] for this recipe. Pour into a bowl and add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [2], pepper, salt, and thyme leaves [3].
Beat with a whisk [4], then dilute with a little of the pasta cooking water [5]. Make sure there are no bones in the salmon and remove the skin from the swordfish [6], 
then cut the tuna [7], salmon [8], and swordfish [9] into cubes around 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size.
By this point the water should be at a boil [10]. Toss in the pasta and undercook it by a couple of minutes. In the meantime, heat a little oil in a pan, and add the whole peeled garlic clove. Once the sauce is hot, add the fish cubes [11] and fry over high heat for around 1 minute. Remove the garlic [12], 
add the white wine [13] and let it simmer. Once the alcohol has evaporated, remove the fish cubes with a skimmer [14], set aside, and lower the heat. Once the pasta is al dente, take a ladleful of water [15] and pour it into the pan, 
drain the spaghetti, and add that too [16]. Thicken for around 1 minute, stirring continuously [17] to release the starches from the pasta, adding some cooking water if necessary. Pour in the egg yolk mixture [18] 
and the fish cubes [19]. Stir well and add a little more water from the pasta if necessary [20]. Your seafood carbonara is ready. Plate it up while still piping hot and garnish with grated cheese and pepper to taste [21].
