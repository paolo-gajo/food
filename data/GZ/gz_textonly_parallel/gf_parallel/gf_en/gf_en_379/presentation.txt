Typical of Middle Eastern cuisine, hummus is a sauce made from chickpeas and tahini that is appreciated all over the world! In addition to being quick and easy to make, it is an extremely versatile recipe that lends itself to various types of dishes. Furthermore, being very nutritious, it adapts perfectly to the needs of those who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet. Traditional preparation involves the use of a mortar and pestle, but for convenience and practicality we have preferred to show you the simplest method with a blender. Also for this reason we opted for the ready-made tahini, easily available in all supermarkets, but those who wish will find at the bottom of the recipe the steps to make it at home, starting with toasted sesame seeds. Whatever procedure you choose, once you have obtained the hummus base you can then decide to flavor it to your liking, for example with paprika and parsley, as in our version! Are you looking for some ideas on how to serve it? Hummus is perfect to accompany pita and vegetable sticks as an appetizer or aperitif, but it can also become an ingredient for delicious recipes!
