To make brownies, start by finely chopping and melting the dark chocolate in a bain-marie or in the microwave, then pour it in a bowl [1]. Melt the butter too, then add it to the melted chocolate [2]. Stir vigorously with a spatula [3] and leave to cool.
To make brownies, begin by finely chopping the dark chocolate. Melt it using a bain-marie or in the microwave, and then transfer it to a bowl [1]. Melt the butter and combine it with the melted chocolate [2]. Mix well using a spatula [3] and set aside to cool.
In the meantime, toast the hazelnuts in a pan [4] and set them aside. In a separate, large bowl, combine the eggs and sugar [5]. Add a pinch of salt and beat the mixture using an electric whisk until it's light in color and frothy [6].
After the egg mixture is prepared, gradually incorporate the cooled melted chocolate and butter mixture [7], stirring continuously. Next, sift the flour [8] and cocoa powder into the bowl [9].
Combine the sifted powders into the wet ingredients, stirring until you achieve a glossy and consistent batter [10]. Add in the toasted hazelnuts [11] and fold them in using a spatula [12].
Prepare a baking dish by lining it with parchment paper [13]. Pour the brownie batter into the dish, ensuring a smooth surface [14]. Bake in a preheated oven at 350Â°F for 25 minutes [15].
Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool completely [16]. After they've cooled, cut them into squares [17]. Your brownies are now ready to be savored [18]!
