One of the most delicious memories from a trip to the United States are those chocolate squares enriched with dried fruit, beautifully displayed in the windows of bakeries and caf√©s... we're obviously talking about brownies! Melty on the inside with a slight crust on the outside, brownies are often served as a dessert paired with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. However, they originally started as a convenient, easy-to-carry snack. Here, we present the original recipe with dark chocolate, cocoa, and hazelnuts, but there are countless variations you can experiment with... Get started now, and you'll find they are as delectable as they are simple to make.
