Today we open the doors of the Giallo Zafferano kitchen to a great master of Italian patisserie: Paolo Sacchetti, who with his broad smile revealed all the secrets for preparing ladyfingers! Because in the kitchen, just like in life, the important thing is to put all your passion into whatever it is you are doing... we will explain how to prepare them, but you will only achieve perfect ladyfingers is you put all your love into it! Thanks to their proverbial lightness, these biscuits are perfect for dipping in milk in the morning, for a sweet breakfast, or served with zabaglione, for preparing one of the most classic desserts: tiramisu'! Ladyfingers can also be used as a base for making spoon desserts, likeÂ trifle, or for decorating an elegant dessert. Extremely versatile and a timeless classic, even though novelties always stimulate the palate. Whatever you are aiming for, pay attention: the more air incorporated, the better they will be for dipping!
