To make the cookie cheesecake, start from the base: melt the butter in a saucepan over very low heat and let it cool. Meanwhile, put the cookies [1] in a mixer and blend them finely [2]. Transfer them to a bowl, add the previously melted butter [3] and
mix with a spoon [4]. Grease and line a mold with parchment paper. Pour the crumbled cookies in the pan [5] and, with the back of a spoon, compact the cookie base well [6]. Let the base cool in the refrigerator for half an hour or in the freezer for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, let's move to the filling: soak the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for at least 10 minutes [7]. In the meantime, pour the cream into the mixer (set aside two tablespoons of heavy cream, as you will need to dissolve the gelatin in it) and whisk it [8]. Transfer the cream in a small bowl and place it in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. Then in the same bowl of the planetary mixer, pour the cream cheese, add the sugar [9].
Add the vanilla extract [10] (you can also use the seeds of 1 vanilla bean as an alternative) and mix until it becomes a homogeneous cream. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the two tablespoons of heavy cream set aside previously. When hot, turn off the heat and add the squeezed gelatine sheets [11]. Mix to make it dissolve completely (this step is very important for a good firming of the cream) and let it cool. When it reaches room temperature, add the cream with gelatin in the cream cheese [12] and mix. You can also do these steps in a bowl of an electric mixer.
Incorporate the whipped cream to the cream cheese [13], adding it a little at a time and stirring gently with a spatula from bottom to top [14] until homogeneous. Then coarsely chop the cookies [15]
and add them to the cream [16]. Mix with a spatula and pour the mixture in the pan with the now cooled cookie base [17]. Level the surface [18].
Place the cheesecake in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours to firm. Once the cookie cheesecake is ready, unmold it by removing the opening circle from the pan, gently remove the base of the mold and place it on a serving dish [19]. Decorate the surface with crumbled cookies [20] and your cheesecake is ready to be enjoyed!
