To prepare your breaded cutlet rolls, start by beating the meat between two sheets of parchment paper to keep the fibers intact and keep it tender [1]. Break the eggs into a small bowl, lightly season with salt [2] and pepper to taste, then whisk with a fork [3].
Dip the turkey fillets into the egg one at a time [4], then coat both sides with breadcrumbs (5-6).
Divide the fillets into equal portions [7] and place one slice of cheese [8] and one slice of ham [9] on each portion. 
Roll up the fillet portions [10] and secure with a toothpick [11]. You can fry them in plenty of vegetable oil, which should be no hotter than 360°F (180°C) [12] (check this with a kitchen thermometer). Alternatively, you can bake them in the oven. In this case, it’s best to cook one roll first to find the best time and temperature before baking the rest.
Brown the rolls for a few minutes, turning them to cook them evenly [13], and then drain with a slotted spoon before placing on a tray lined with paper towel [14]. Serve the breaded cutlet rolls piping hot [15]!
