Who doesn’t know and love the classic Italian recipe for the breaded cutlet known as cotoletta? Whether it’s Milan-style, Palermo-style, or whichever cooking style you prefer – breaded and fried or baked – it’s always a tasty main course. Just imagine if the cutlet were stuffed and served as a succulent roll, as we suggest in this recipe. Our breaded cutlet rolls are filled with cheese and ham slices, making them inviting and irresistible! You can also vary the filling if you prefer and bake them in the oven instead of frying!
