To prepare tuna and potato bites, start by placing the potatoes in cold water and boiling them [1] for around 40 minutes [2]. Cooking time will vary according to the size of potatoes; pierce them with a fork to check they are done: if the prongs sink in easily, then they are ready. Now drain and peel them, then mash inside a bowl using a masher [3].
Leave to cool and in the meantime, finely chop the thyme and sage [4]. As soon as the potatoes are no longer boiling hot, add the finely chopped aromatic herb mix [5] and salt to taste [6].
Add pepper too [7], along with the grated peel of one lemon [8]; stir with a fork [9] to form a uniform mixture.
Now roll into balls of around 0.9 oz [10] and dip in the beaten egg [11], then in the breadcrumbs [12]. While you prepare the balls, heat the oil in a saucepan to 340°F (170°C) (measure with a cooking thermometer).
When the oil is hot, add a few balls at a time [14]. Fry the tuna and potato balls for around 3 minutes, then drain with a colander and place on a sheet of oil-absorbing cooking paper [14]. Finish frying and serve your tuna and potato bites piping hot [15].
