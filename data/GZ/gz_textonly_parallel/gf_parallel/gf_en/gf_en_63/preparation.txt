To make the tiramisu semifreddo, infuse the coffee beans in the cream for at least 2 hours and even better if overnight [1]. In this way the cream will be flavored with coffee without absorbing its color. Cover with the plastic wrap [2] and leave in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, prepare the Italian meringue: put the sugar in a saucepan, setting aside two tablespoons from the indicated dose [3]. Pour the water and heat over medium heat to form the syrup,
immerse a food thermometer [4] to make sure that the syrup reaches a temperature of 250°F (121°C). When the syrup has reached 240°F (115°C), start beating the egg whites with a pinch of salt in a planetary mixer fitted with a whisk, when the egg whites begin to become light add the remaining sugar kept aside [5]. Once the syrup reaches 250°F (121°C), pour it flush into the mixer in action [6],
continue to whisk until the meringue is cold [7]. Filter the coffee from the cream with a colander [8] and whip it with an electric whisk [9].
Separately in a bowl, soften the mascarpone and then add it to the Italian meringue with a spatula [10], also add the cream, gently so as not to dismantle it [11]. Pour the mixture into a 10x5" (26x12 cm) mold with a 3" (7 cm) high edge, fill the mold to the brim. Brush the surface to level it [12]. Place in the refrigerator and continue with the preparation.
Prepare the coffee with the mocha and let it cool, pouring it into a large, low bowl. Then sweeten to taste [13]. Cut out the tip of the ladyfingers to finish them [14]. Take back the semifreddo, soak the ladyfingers quickly so as not to soften them too much and distribute them on the surface of the cake next to each other [15],
you have to cover the entire surface [16]. Place the semifreddo in the freezer for at least another two hours. After the firming time, remove the semifreddo from the freezer and unmold it: to facilitate this operation you can immerse the mold for a few moments in boiling water [17] or you can help yourself with a torch by heating the mold. Then turn the semifreddo over onto a serving dish and, if necessary, level the surface with a spatula. With a potato peeler, make curls from the cube - or from the bar - of chocolate. Garnish the cake with dark chocolate curls [18]. The tiramisu semifreddo is ready to be enjoyed.
