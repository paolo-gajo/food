To make pasta del maresciallo, start by peeling and finely slicing the onion [1]. Place the sliced onion in a pan [2], together with the pancetta bacon [3]
and two spoons of olive oil [4]. Brown for around 3 minutes on the stove, on a high flame. Add the crushed tomatoes [5], salt to taste [6], stir and cook the sauce for 15 minutes on a moderate flame.
In the meantime, bring salted water to the boil in a saucepan, to cook the pasta. Cook the pasta [7] for as long as it says on the packet and drain when firm to the bite. In the meantime, add the fresh cream to the sauce [8] and stir to amalgamate [9].
Flavor with the basil leaves [10] and when the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it straight to the pan with the sauce [11]. Saut? the pasta for a few moments so that it finishes cooking and to coat it in the sauce. Serve the pasta nice and hot, garnished with the basil leaves [12].
