This is one of Italy’s most succulent baked pasta dishes and has all the ingredients for a truly unforgettable meal: paccheri pasta stuffed with sausage and mushrooms! The creaminess of the cheese and béchamel sauce, the appetizing taste of the sausage and mushrooms, the impeccable spoked arrangement in the baking tin… a tasty, flavor-packed dish that takes a little time, like all classic Italian home-cooked dishes, but all your efforts will be repaid when you bear this delicacy triumphantly to the table. This pasta shape is ideal for filling and each little cylinder will release a delectable burst of flavor in the mouth. We have used the same tasty trick for other recipes such as stuffed pasta shells (conchiglioni). Whether you’re feeding friends or making a family Sunday lunch, stuffed paccheri pasta will get top billing on your menu. We're sure everyone will beg you for the recipe… and the more refined version of the dish with salt cod on cheese fondue is ideal for a special holiday treat!
