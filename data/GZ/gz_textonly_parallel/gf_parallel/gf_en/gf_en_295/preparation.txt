To make paccheri pasta stuffed with sausage and mushrooms, wash, trim and slice the leek [1]. Then clean the mushrooms, remove any remaining soil with a slightly damp cloth as instructed in our “how to clean mushrooms” practical guide, and dice them finely [2]. Add the olive oil and the whole garlic clove to a large saucepan, tip in the sliced leek [3] and soften over low heat for at least 10 minutes. 
While the leeks are cooking, remove the sausage skins, crumble them [4], and add to the pan [5] when the leeks are soft. Brown the sausage over low heat, turning frequently, then add the white wine [6]. 
Allow this to evaporate for a few moments, then add the tomato concentrate [7] and mushrooms [8]. Cook over high heat for 10 minutes, then add the salt and pepper and remove the garlic clove [9].
Before turning off the heat, make sure that the mixture in the pan is dry, then season with salt, pepper, and thyme [10]. Leave everything to cool. Prepare a fairly runny béchamel sauce by melting the butter in a pan [11], adding the flour [12], 
stirring until the mixture is lightly browned and adding the hot milk [13]. Stir well until the béchamel sauce begins to bubble, then add salt and powdered nutmeg [14]. When the béchamel sauce has thickened slightly, turn off the heat [15]. Place a saucepan full of salted water on the heat and bring to a boil. This will be used to cook the paccheri pasta.
Meanwhile, transfer the ricotta to a bowl, add ¾ cup (80 g) of Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese [16] and the leek, sausage, and mushroom mixture [17], stir and add salt if necessary [18]. 
Place the mixture into a pastry bag without a nozzle [19]. Boil the paccheri pasta in plenty of salted water [20], draining them when they are half cooked. Lightly oil to stop them from sticking together [21] (be careful not to break them).
Spread half of the béchamel sauce over the bottom of a round ovenproof dish (or baking tin) with a base diameter of 9 inches (22 cm) [22] and arrange the paccheri pasta next to one another in concentric circles, starting from the outer perimeter of the ovenproof dish and working inwards until the layer is complete [23]. Transfer the mushroom and sausage mixture to the pastry bag [24] and use it to fill the paccheri.
Sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese [25], then add the rest of the béchamel sauce [26] and a few thyme leaves. Bake the stuffed paccheri in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for approximately 25 minutes + 5 minutes broiling under the grill to brown the surface. Take the paccheri pasta stuffed with sausage and mushrooms out of the oven, leave to settle for 5-10 minutes, and then serve [27]!
