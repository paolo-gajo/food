A soft base, a rich and melted filling and an ultra-fragrant surface! These are just 3 of the essential adjectives for describing a parigina. Let's take things one step at a time. What is it? It is a rustic pizza, so basically the classic dough used for making pizza margherita. However, it is also a filled, or stuffed pizza, as they would say in Naples, with quite a characterizing topping: tomato, cheese and cooked ham. Lastly, there's a layer of puff pastry. As strange as this addition may sound, the puff pastry is actually what makes it so popular. Parigina pizza is a product that is difficult to find in pizza restaurants in the evening. You are more likely to come across it in delis and bars, ready to be enjoyed as a snack or a quick lunch. PariginaÂ wins everyone over with its simplicity and flavor; it is one of the most highly appreciated street foods by our Neapolitan friends. We will now explain how you can make it at home too.
