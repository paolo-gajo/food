To prepare parigina pizza, start with the pizza dough: place the water at room temperature in a bowl and dissolve the yeast [1] by stirring with a fork [2]. Place the flour and sugar in a bowl and stir by hand [3]
before gradually adding the water with the yeast [4]. Slowly incorporate and knead by hand [5] until the dough takes shape [6].
As soon as the dough takes shape, gradually add the oil [7]. Add half, then the salt [8], incorporate, and now add the remaining part of the oil. Knead once more to obtain a homogeneous mixture [9].
Place it on a pastry board and continue to knead for another 10-15 minutes [10]. Gently roll the dough into a smooth and homogeneous ball; if too soft, add a pinch of flour. Now place the ball in a large container [11], cover with plastic wrap and leaven at a temperature of 82°F (27°C) for around 3 hours [12].
In the meantime, drain the peeled tomatoes and leave them to rest for a few minutes so that they become nice and dry [13]. Now remove the rind of the caciocavallo and thinly slice the cheese [14]. Once drained, the tomatoes should weigh around 1 lb (500 g) [15].
Press them down with a fork, or finely chop them with a knife [16]. Once leavened, the dough should triple in volume: remove the wrap [17] and place it on a previously greased 12x15 inch (32x38 cm) oven tray. Spread the dough out with your fingers, but don't worry too much if it shrinks: persist, without making a hole or tearing it [18].
Cover the dough once more and leave to rest for twenty minutes or so [19]. Once this time is up, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the tomatoes over the entire surface, leaving around an inch or so free around the edges [20]. Now coat with the slices of cooked ham [21].
Add the sliced caciocavallo cheese [22]: try to evenly cover the entire surface [23]. Lastly, spread the puff pastry and try to obtain a rectangle that is large enough to cover the pizza [24].
Place the puff pastry over the pastry, even out the edges and perforate the surface with the prongs of a fork [25]. Place the egg yolk and cream in a bowl and stir [26], then dab this mixture onto the surface with a brush [27].
Bake in a static oven preheated to 392°F (200°C) for around 30-35 minutes [28]. Once the baking time is up [29], remove the pizza and leave it to cool for 5 minutes. Remove the parigina from the tray and cut it into 12 pieces with a serrated knife [30].
