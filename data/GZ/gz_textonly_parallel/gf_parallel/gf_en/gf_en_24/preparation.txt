To make wild berry strudel, first start with the dough: Add the flour, salt, eggs [1], and water to a bowl [2], mix with a fork to absorb the liquid, and then add the oil a little at a time [3].
Continue mixing. Once all the ingredients are combined [4], transfer the dough to a pastry board and knead by hand to form an even little mound [5]. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave to rest for an hour in a cool place [6].
Meanwhile, turn to the filling: Place the washed berries in a bowl, add brown sugar [7], and mix. Take the ball of dough and place on a lightly floured cloth [8]. Roll out to a thickness of a coin (1-2 mm) with a rolling pin [9].
Then roll out the dough again, gently stretching with the palm of your hands [10] while taking care not to break the sheet. The resulting rectangle should measure approximately 16x20 inches (40x50 cm). Now brush the surface with melted butter [11] and sprinkle one-third of the pastry with breadcrumbs [12].
Add the leftover bread crumbs to the berries and mix [13]. Spread all the berries on the side of the pastry that you covered with breadcrumbs [14]. Now use the tea towel to roll up the strudel from the short side of the rectangle [15].
Fold over the ends to seal [16], brush the surface with leftover melted butter [17], and make diagonal cuts across the top [18].
Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 370°F (190°C) for 30-35 minutes. Once cooked, take the strudel out of the oven [19], allow to cool, and then dust the surface with powdered sugar [20]. Your wild berry strudel is ready to serve [21].
