Apple strudel is a simple and wholesome dessert from the Trentino-Alto Adige region that’s earned its place among Italy’s traditional recipes. The success of this crumbly roll of puff pastry filled with local ingredients has inspired a host of sweet and savory spin-offs. These include a colorful, down-to-earth vegetable strudel, cocoa strudel with a soft filling of cinnamon-scented pears, and shortcrust strudel. We’ve come up with another tempting version dedicated to lovers of fruit desserts: wild berry strudel. This tasty treat with a juicy center can be served as a dessert accompanied by a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of fresh cream, or it can be enjoyed as a special snack!
