To make pumpkin cordon bleu, start by peeling the pumpkin [1]. Then cut it into slices that are around 0.2 inches thick [2]. You should end up with 12 [3].
Now beat the eggs in a bowl with salt and pepper [4]. Place the breadcrumbs in a baking tray, add the finely chopped rosemary, the parmigiano cheese [5] and the powdered peperoncino [6]. Stir with a spoon and leave to one side.
Place half a slice of cooked ham [4] on the first pumpkin slice, then add a slice of mozzarella cheese [5]. Top with another pumpkin slice [6]. Repeat with the remaining slices.
Hold both pumpkin pieces together and dip the cordon bleu in the egg [10], then in the breadcrumbs and once more in the egg [11] and the breadcrumbs [12]. In this way you will create a double breadcrumb coating.
Place on a tray [13] and repeat for all the other pieces. In the meantime, heat the oil to 290°F (145°C). Once heated to the right temperature, use a skimmer to place the first cordon bleu in the oil [14] and cook for around 5 minutes [15],
until nice and golden. Now drain [16] and place it on a tray lined with kitchen paper [17]. Continue in the same way. It's best to fry 1-2 pieces at a time to prevent the oil temperature from dropping too much. Add a little salt and serve the pumpkin cordon bleu nice and hot [18].
