Queen of the winter and rich in autumn colors, pumpkin accompanies us during both seasons with its unique sweetness. Its unmistakable flavor makes it suitable for all kinds of recipes, both sweet and savory. Today we've used it for a rather unusual recipe, which won us over right away! Pumpkin cordon bleu are extremely crunchy, thanks to their double breadcrumb coating, but they contain a soft filling and a melted heart. Just like the more traditional recipe with chicken, there will be no shortage of cooked ham, and this second dish will be perfect for all occasions, as a dinner with friends.
