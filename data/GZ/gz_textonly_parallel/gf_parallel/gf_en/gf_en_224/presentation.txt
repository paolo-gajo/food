Crunchy, juicy, aromatic, and bursting with flavor... we're talking about pollo alla diavola (grilled chicken)! Although its origins are still uncertain, its name is certainly attributed to one of the spices used to cover the chicken before cooking: chili pepper! Today's recipe is medium hot, but of course you can increase or decrease the amount of spice as you prefer and choose the type of chili pepper you love the most! The characteristic feature of pollo alla diavola is precisely the way it is cooked, and the version we chose is the Roman way, cooked whole in a pan! The secret to getting a crispy skin will be to place a weight on the chicken while it cooks!
