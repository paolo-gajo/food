To prepare the pollo alla diavola (grilled chicken), first take a whole chicken and cut the breastbone in half [1]. Remove the central bone [2] and flatten the chicken completely [3]. 
Now place the salt, aromatic herbs, garlic and chili pepper in a mixer (adjust amounts to taste: the amounts given here are for medium hotness) [4]. Blend the seasonings [5] and pour into a bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (25 g) of oil [6]
and stir with a spoon into a paste [7]. Using a meat tenderizer, lightly flatten the chicken. Spread the freshly prepared seasoning mix on the entire chicken, outside
and inside [10]. Grease a large pan and heat it. Place the chicken in it [11] and place a weight on top. We used a heavy meat tenderizer on an aluminum pan [12]. 
Cook over low heat for about 25 minutes without moving it. Then turn the chicken [13] and you will notice that a nice crust has formed. Cook for another 25 minutes or so, always making sure that the weight presses the chicken down to the bottom of the pan, until the other side is golden too [15]. Do not turn the chicken or move it while cooking.
Now transfer the chicken to a chopping board and, using poultry shears, cut it first in half [16] and then into pieces [17]. Place the chicken pieces on a serving plate and enjoy [18].
