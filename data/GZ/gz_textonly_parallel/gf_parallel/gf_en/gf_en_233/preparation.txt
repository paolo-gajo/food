To make the pizza doughnuts, first prepare the mozzarella cheese. Cut it into slices [1] and leave it to drain in a colander [2]. Then move on to the tomato sauce: Pour the crushed tomatoes into a bowl and add salt [3] and pepper.
Add the oregano [4] and a drizzle of oil, then mix everything together [5]. Place in the refrigerator and in the meantime make the dough: Pour the flour and baking powder [6] into a large bowl. 
Start adding water [7] and knead the dough with your hands until you have used up all the water [8]. Then add the salt [9]
and knead again [10]. Continue to knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface to obtain a uniform, compact dough [11]. Divide into six portions weighing about 4 oz (100 g) each [12].
Once you have obtained six pieces [13], roll out each portion to form sausage-shaped pieces approximately 9 inches (24 cm) in length [14]. Now create doughnuts by joining both ends together and pressing lightly [15].
As you form the doughnuts, transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [16], taking care to press lightly on both ends to double-check that they are sealed [17]. Once you have prepared the 6 doughnuts [18], 
coat them in the tomato sauce you set aside (19-20) and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes [21],
take the doughnuts out of the oven  and spread the mozzarella on top [22]. Then bake again for another 5 minutes until the mozzarella has melted [23]. The pizza doughnuts will be hot and melting [24], ready to be enjoyed.
