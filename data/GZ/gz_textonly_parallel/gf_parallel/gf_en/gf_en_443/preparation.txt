First put a bowl in the freezer and let it cool completely, then soak the gelatin in cold water in a separate container [1]. At this point, prepare the custard. Pour the milk and seeds from the vanilla bean [2] into a pan, and heat until it boils. Meanwhile, in another pan pour the yolks, sugar [3],
cornstarch [4] and stir with a whisk [5] until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. When the milk starts to boil, pour 1/3 of it into the egg yolk mixture [6] and stir. 
Pour the remaining milk in two parts [7]. Put the pan back over the heat, stirring continuously for a few minutes [8] until the cream thickens [9]. 
Take off the heat and stir quickly, so it will be very lucid.At this point take the bowl from the freezer and pour the cream inside [10]; before stirring add the drained gelatin [11] and stir quickly to melt it [12], and let the cream cool. When the cream is no longer hot, place it in the fridge.
In the meantime, half-whip the cream [13]. It should be soft, shiny and not too whipped. Take the custard from the fridge and add 1/3 of the whipped cream [14]. Whip the mixture quickly [15].
Then add the remaining cream in two more parts, stirring with a hand whisk, but more gently [16]. Cover with plastic wrap [17] and plsce the diplomat cream in the refrigerator until needed [18].
