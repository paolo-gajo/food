Neapolitan cuisine is one of the most appreciated in the world. Its secrets are rooted in the history of the different peoples who influenced it. Examples are pizza, sartù, struffoli and today's recipe: babà. Rum babà is a dessert that goes back to the gugelhupf, a sort of very dry doughnut. The addition of a syrup, as is done for the French savarin, has given a better consistency for the palate, making it a more appreciated dessert. Rum babà is served soaked in a delicious rum syrup that can also be enriched with other aromas and even a limoncello version.
