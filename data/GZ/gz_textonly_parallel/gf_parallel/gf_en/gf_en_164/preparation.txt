To prepare rum babà, start with the dough. Pour the flour into the bowl of a food processor and crumble the yeast [1]. Turn on the machine fitted with a spatula at medium-low speed and start mixing the ingredients. Add the eggs, one at a time [2], it is important that they are cold. When they are blended in, add the sugar and mix [3].
 
Then add the salt and let it continue mixing for a few more minutes [4] until it is absorbed; overall it will take 10 minutes. Switch off the food processor and replace the spatula with the hook attachment. Turn on the machine again at medium-low speed and add the butter flakes. You will have to be patient and let each piece be completely absorbed before adding the next one. Once the butter is combined, let the machine mix for a couple more minutes [5]. At this stage, let it continue for 10-15 minutes. At the end of the process the dough will be soft and smooth [6].
Make sure that the capacity of your food processor is at least 2.5 quarts (2.5 liters), otherwise transfer the dough to a larger bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap [7] and leave to rise at a temperature of 78-80°F (26-28°C) for about 3 hours. After this time, butter the molds thoroughly. After the rising time, pick up the dough and gently peel off the part that has stuck to the plastic wrap. Use a wet metal spatula. Gently deflate the dough with your hands (8-9)
With a wet hand take a portion of the dough [10] and squeeze about 2 oz (50/55 grams) of it, cutting it as you do for mozzarella, dropping the piece directly into buttered aluminum molds [11]. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest until the dough rises to the edge [12].
Once ready for cooking, move the babàs onto a drip pan and cook them in a static oven preheated to 360°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes [13], taking care to keep them quite separate from one another. Then let them cool down for about ten minutes before unmolding and let them cool completely: it is better if they are left to cool all night, so that the surface will dry well and the inside will dry completely [14]. Now for the preparation of the syrup: pour the water [15] into a saucepan.
Add the sugar, stir until completely dissolved [16]. Now turn off the heat, add the rum [17] and wait for the water to reach 120°F (50°C), the ideal temperature for soaking, then dip in 1 or 2 babàs. Let them soak for about 1 minute [18], turning them over.
Give them a gentle squeeze 1 or 2 times, gently but firmly: this will soften them and improve the soaking [19]. After the last dip, if you prefer, you can stop squeezing them. Drain them on a grill with a plate underneath [20] and repeat the process with all the others. Collect the excess syrup as you go. Your rum babàs are ready to be served [21]. You can enjoy them plain or garnished with whipped cream and strawberries, or custard and sour cherries!
