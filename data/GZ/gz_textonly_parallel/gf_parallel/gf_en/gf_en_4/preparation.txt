Start with the vegetable broth when making zucchini risotto. Put a pot of clean, unpeeled, and cut seasonal vegetables on the stove. Salt, add pepper grains, and bring to a boil. In the meantime, clean and finely chop the white onion with a knife [1]. Put in a bowl and move to the stove. Pour a drizzle of oil into a saucepan and add the onion [2]. Cook over low heat for about ten minutes, stirring often: it will help make the onion brown. If the bottom dries out, add very little hot broth [3].
Turn up the heat and pour in the rice [4] letting it toast for a few minutes while stirring continuously and ensuring that the grains do not burn [5]. As soon as the rice has taken on a lighter color, simmer with white wine until reduced[6].
Let the alcohol evaporate completely, then add a few ladles of simmering broth [7]. Remember that the risotto should not be mixed much, and the broth should be poured as needed before the rice has completely absorbed it [8]. In the meantime, cut the zucchini, already washed and dried, [9]
and grate them with an extra coarse grater [10]. Halfway through cooking, place the zucchini in the risotto [11], stir [12].
and continue cooking [13]. Turn off the heat and add the mint leaves [14], the black pepper by hand [15],
then the butter [16] and grated Parmesan cheese cold from the fridge [17]. Stir and add very little broth to adjust the consistency if needed. Let rest for a few minutes, with the lid on, and then serve your zucchini risotto [18].
