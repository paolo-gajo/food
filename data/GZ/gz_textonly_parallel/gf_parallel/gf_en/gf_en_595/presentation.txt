The almond crumble (sbrisolona) is a traditional almond cake from Lombardy, the pride of the city of Mantua: it is a hard, crumbly, and richly flavored cake that is made and served in coarse pieces. Its name in Italian means "crumbs". Maestro Iginio Massari has put his hands in the dough for us, showing us how easy it is to prepare this cake of humble origins thatÂ is much appreciated abroad, so much so as to be part of the Italian culinary heritage.
