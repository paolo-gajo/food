To prepare the almond crumble you will need unpeeled almond flour [1]. Place the flour 00, yeast [2] and corn flour [3] on the work surface
with the almond flour [4]. Create the classic mound [5]. In the middle, place the butter, salt [6],
eggs [7] and sugar [8]. Start working the ingredients placed in the middle with your hands [9]. 
Add the maraschino [10] and coarsely chopped raw almonds [11]. Keep kneading with your hands, and add the seeds from the vanilla bean. Work the dry ingredients in a cross shape, bringing the ingredients from the outside to the inside, handling and mixing them with the rest [12].
You will obtain a homogeneous consistency in a few moments [13]. Now transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with baking paper and push it down with your hands [14]. Place in the freezer to let the dough cool for at least 4 hours. As soon as the dough is rigid, you can prepare the crumbs. [15]
Place a cooling rack with 1/2 inch (1 cm) square holes on a bowl, cut the dough into pieces and crumble it by passing it through the grater [16]. This way you will obtain big crumbs [17]. Take a flared aluminum mold measuring 13 inches (32 cm) on the surface and 11 inches (28 cm) on the bottom; place a circle of baking paper inside and pour the crumbs in [18]. 
Spread them gently without pressing [19]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 340°F (170°C) for 45 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool [20] before removing it from the mold and serving [21].
