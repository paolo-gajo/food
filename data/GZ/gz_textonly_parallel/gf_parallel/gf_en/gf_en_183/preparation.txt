To prepare ricotta and jam tart, start by making the whipped shortcrust pastry. Place the soft and diced butter in a bowl, add the muscovado sugar [1] and the grated peel of half a lemon [2]. Add a pinch of salt [3]
and use a whisk to stir the ingredients together [4] to obtain a smooth cream [5]. Now gradually add the eggs [6] and whisk for another minute.
Add the flour [7] and continue to whisk [8] until fully absorbed [9].
Stir the shortcrust pastry thoroughly with a spatula to amalgamate it well [10]. Butter a 9 inch mold [11] and place the shortcrust pastry inside a pastry bag with a smooth 0.4 inch (1 cm) nozzle [12].
Form a spiral inside the mold, to cover the entire surface [13]. Now use the remaining shortcrust dough to make the edge taller, by adding spirals of dough until there is none left (14-15).
Use a damp spoon to impress a decorative pattern along the entire edge of the tart (16-17). Place back in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the ricotta cream: stir the ricotta in a bowl, add the honey [18],
the peel of half a lemon [19], and stir to amalgamate well [20]. Take the tart base and place the ricotta in the middle of it [21]
then use a spatula to evenly spread it over the entire surface [22]. Now sieve the raspberry jam [23] to eliminate the seeds. Add it to the ricotta [24]
and spread it evenly over the surface [25]. Bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 40 minutes on the middle shelf, until the shortcrust pastry is golden. Remove from the oven, wait for it to cool slightly [26], remove from the mold and serve the ricotta and jam tart at room temperature [27].
