We've made one or two tarts, that's for sure. From simpler ones with jam, to soft chocolate sponge, and we've fallen in love with each and every one of them. Today we've tried a new way of making one of the most well-known desserts, prepared by grandmothers all over Italy for Sunday lunch. What makes this one different is how the shortcrust pastry transforms: the ingredients are the same, but the butter is whipped and becomes a soft cloud. The result will be a soft shortcrust pastry, which you'll place inside a pastry bag to line your mold with. Once baked it will be unbeatably fragrant! For the filling we've chosen a lemon-flavored ricotta cream and raspberry jam, complete with a rustic decoration befitting a dessert only grandmothers know how to make!
