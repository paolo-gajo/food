To prepare chocolate cupcakes, start by mixing all the powders together in a bowl: sieve the flour, the yeast [1] and then the unsweetened cocoa powder [2]. Finely chop the dark chocolate [3]
and melt in a bain-marie (or in the microwave), then leave it to one side [4]. Place the butter in a bowl (softened at room temperature), along with the sugar [5] and beat the mixture with an electric whisk [6].
Now incorporate the eggs, one at a time [7], beating with the whisk all the while: you'll need to create a frothy and firm mixture. Add the butter and sugar, then the milk [8] and the melted dark chocolate [9];
stir thoroughly together with the whisk (10-11) and last of all, gradually add the powders by sieving them through a colander [12]. Stir with a spatula in a circular motion from the bottom up.
Stir with the spatula until the cupcake dough becomes homogeneous [13]. Now you can add some chopped hazelnuts or chocolate drops to your cupcakes, to make them even more morish. Place the dough in a pastry bag without a nozzle (14-15).
Place the paper cups in a muffin mold and fill each one 3/4 to the top by squeezing the pastry bag (16-17). Bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 15-20 minutes. Check they are done by piercing with a toothpick, which should come out clean. Remove from the oven, leave to cool [18]...and here they are: your chocolate cupcakes are ready!
