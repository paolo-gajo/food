Today let's prepare one of the true classic American sweets: chocolate cupcakes! Perfect served for breakfast, as a snack, or even for a birthday buffet and other special occasions! Chocolate cupcakes are also great for decorating with simple or colored butter cream, or other toppings, to create effects that are always different and perhaps create a contrast with the chocolate dough. We've already found lots of occasions for decorating our chocolate cupcakes: spiderweb cupcakes for Halloween, heart ones for Valentines Day and multicolored carnival ones too! Let us know how you'll prepare yours!
