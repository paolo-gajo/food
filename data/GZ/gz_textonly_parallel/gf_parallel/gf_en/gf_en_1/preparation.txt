To prepare the pandoro sponge cake, start with the filling. If your ricotta is too rich in whey, then drain it in a colander and store it in the refrigerator for about an hour. After the time has passed, change or dry the bowl and strain the ricotta cheese [1]. Then add the powdered sugar and mix it in [2]. Coarsely chop the dark chocolate [3]
and add it to the ricotta [4]. After stirring, finish the mixture by grating the orange peel (set the orange aside, because you will need the juice later) [5]. Stir one last time [6] and set the filling aside.
Now cut the pandoro cake: eliminate the top slice (the canopy), then cut four slices about 2/5 inch (1 cm) thick [7], setting aside the smallest piece, which will be served whole [8]. Divide the two central slices in half [9],
while the last one, the largest of the four, can be cut to obtain a disc: just use a pastry ring with a diameter of 4 1/2 inches (11.5 cm) [10]. Take a semi-spherical sponge cake mold, place the smallest slice left whole on the bottom. Then coat the walls of the mold so the tips of the slices cut in half fit together [11]. If necessary, you can rearrange them. Pour the ricotta cream inside [12]
and level the surface carefully. Then close it with the round slice you cut earlier, [13] press gently to compact everything together [14] and wrap with plastic wrap. Let rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours [15].
After this time has passed, take the pandoro sponge cake out, remove the wrap and turn it upside down carefully on a grill placed on a plate [16]. Squeeze and filter the orange juice: only 2 tbsp (30 g) are needed. Brush the surface of the zuccotto [17] then put it back in the refrigerator without covering it [18].
In the meantime, prepare the topping: cut the chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie [19]. When it has melted, turn off the heat and add the cream, pouring it little by little and stirring continuously [20]. Then take your sponge cake and cover it with the chocolate cream, letting it drip on the plate placed under the grill [21].
Use a spatula to even out the thickness [22] and sprinkle with a little powered sugar, if desider [23]: your pandoro sponge cake is ready to be served [24]!
