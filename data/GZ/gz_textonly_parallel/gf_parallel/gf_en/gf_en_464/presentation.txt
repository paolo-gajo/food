Coffee is an after-lunch treat, but there is another, sweeter way to get your energy hit: crema al caffè. Don’t confuse it with the much more elaborate coffee-flavored diplomat cream or the pastry cream version, both of which are fabulous for filling and decorating a delicious cake! This is the classic whipped cream mixture you get at Italian bars, except better because you can make it yourself with just three ingredients: cream, sugar, and coffee. You can get by with just two ingredients if you like your coffee unsweetened! This fabulous coffee cream can be served as a filling for croissants or with biscuits: We’ve done the research on your behalf and think it tastes best with the gluten-free ones!
