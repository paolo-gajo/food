When preparing coffee cream, firstly make a batch of coffee in your Italian moka coffee pot, you will need ? cup (70 g). Then add sugar [1], mix well [2], and let the coffee cool at room temperature for a few minutes before placing in the fridge for at least 2 hours. When the 2 hours are up, pour the whipping cream into a pre-chilled bowl [3].
Start to whisk it with an electric beater [4]. As soon as it is half-whipped (i.e., just beginning to thicken) [5] add the previously sweetened coffee that has been chilling in the refrigerator [6]. Pour it slowly onto the cream and carry on beating.
Continue to whisk until the whipped cream is ready [7]. Then cover with plastic wrap [8] and return to the fridge for at least an hour before serving your coffee cream [9].
