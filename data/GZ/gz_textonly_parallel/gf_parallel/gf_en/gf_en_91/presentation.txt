Stuffed eggplant is a traditional rustic Spanish dish, which, over time, has become very widespread throughout Italy too, giving rise to an interesting array of variations. Every region has come up with its own version based on its typical products, and many would like to claim to be the original. Stuffed eggplant is also a family tradition, one of grandma’s classic recipes, often cooked in the summertime in particular thanks to the abundance of this vegetable during that season. It’s no coincidence that stuffed eggplant is great to eat either hot or cold! From north to south, eggplants are stuffed with a whole range of ingredients, including meat, pasta, vegetables, and rice, and, as a result, they can be served as appetizers, first courses, second courses, or side dishes, and even as desserts. Moving from region to region, besides changing the filling and type of course when it’s served, the name changes as well based on the local dialect. Today, we’ve decided to show you one of the most classic recipes: The eggplants are emptied of their flesh, which is then cooked together with meat to create a tasty, flavorful filling. Covered with plenty of tomato sauce and sprinkled with mature pecorino cheese, they’re given a final blast in the oven to meld all the flavors together. Stuffed eggplant is also a perfect dish to eat at room temperature on hotter days. Try it for yourself!
