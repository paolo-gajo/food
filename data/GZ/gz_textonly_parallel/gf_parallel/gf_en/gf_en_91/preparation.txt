To make stuffed eggplant, first wash and dry the eggplants [1]. Cut them in half longways, including the stem [2]. Empty the insides of the eggplants [3]. 
Chop the flesh roughly [4]. Next, dice the onion [5]. Pour some oil into a pan, then add the onion and stew for a few minutes [6]. 
Add the meat and brown for 3-4 minutes[7]. Deglaze with the white wine [8], allowing it to evaporate, then add the eggplant flesh [9]. 
Leave this to cook for 4-5, seasoning with salt and pepper, then pour in the tomato purée (be sure to save around 1¾ tbsp (30 g) for later) [10] and the basil leaves [11]. Turn off the heat. Cut the stale bread [12] into small pieces and then blitz in a food processor. 
Grate the caciocavallo using a coarse grater [13]. Add the breadcrumbs and cheese [14] to the pan and stir [15]. 
Next, arrange the eggplants in a baking dish, drizzle with oil [16], season with salt [17], and then stuff with the filling [18]. 
Pour over the tomato purée you set aside before [19], then dress with a splash of oil [20] and cook in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 30 minutes. Once the stuffed eggplant has finished cooking, serve it piping hot [21].
