To prepare roasted pumpkin, wash the vegetable, as you will bake it in its skin. Remove the seeds using a spoon [1]. Now cut it into 8 slices (cut the pumpkin piece in two to make this task easier, and continue to obtain slices that are the same size) [2]. Use part of the oil to grease the baking tray [3]
and arrange the pumpkin slices on it [4], then drizzle with the remaining oil [5] and turn them over to grease them evenly all over. Remove the rosemary needles and finely chop them using a knife [6].
Season the pumpkin with a pinch of salt and dash of pepper, then add the finely chopped rosemary [7], the paprika [8] and finally, the pumpkin seeds and almond shards [9].
Now simply place in a static oven preheated to 360Â°F for 40-45 minutes [10]. In the meantime you can prepare the flavored oil. Finely chop some sage leaves [11] and do the same with the sprig of parsley [12].
Place in a bowl and add the oil, stir thoroughly [13]. When the pumpkin is baked, drizzle the oil over it [14]. Your inviting roasted pumpkin is ready to be enjoyed, buon appetito [15]!
