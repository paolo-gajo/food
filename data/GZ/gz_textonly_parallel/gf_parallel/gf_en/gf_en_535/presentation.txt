This time you have no excuse, at the next party you will make the cake with your own hands! You will not need any cake designer's skills for the brick cake (layered no-bake cake) we have designed for you. Inspired by the goodness and simplicity of tiramis√π (mascarpone cheese and ladyfingers dessert), we have created a layered dessert in which custard, cocoa and dry biscuits soaked in milk alternate, a small trick to make a quick and easy base to fill! All topped with a white, frothy layer of whipped cream, as what kind of cake would it be without whipped cream? The ingredients for an easy-to-make dessert are all there and, once you have tried the cake, you can unleash your imagination by experimenting with other delicious fillings.
