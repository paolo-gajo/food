To make the brick cake (layered no-bake cake), start by preparing the custard: first cut the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds [1] with a small knife. In a thick-bottomed pan, pour the milk and cream [2], add the vanilla bean [3] and seeds and bring everything to a boil
Pour the yolks into a separate bowl, add the sugar [4] and beat quickly with a wire whisk [5] until the mixture is light and homogeneous. Next, sift the cornstarch [6] directly into the bowl and stir to blend in the starch.
Add a ladle of hot milk and cream mixture [7]. Now remove the vanilla bean from the pan and pour in the egg mixture [8]. Let it thicken over low heat, stirring continuously with a whisk [9].
Continue cooking until the cream has thickened; now pour it immediately into an oven pan [10], let it cool, then cover with plastic wrap [11] and place in the refrigerator to harden. Take a rectangular 11x15-inch (29x39 cm) pan. Cover the bottom and sides with plastic wrap and start making the cake: soak a biscuit in room temperature milk for about 10 seconds [12] and place it in the baking pan.
Add the first layer of custard on the biscuits, about 3 tablespoons [13] will be enough. Level the cream well with a spatula or the back of a spoon, then sprinkle the unsweetened cocoa using a sieve [14]. Continue with a second layer of soaked biscuits [15],
then with custard and cocoa [16]. You will need to obtain 6 layers in total. Finish with a layer of biscuits and put the cake to harden in the fridge for 3 hours. Then take out the cake, transfer it to a serving plate using the plastic wrap to lift it [17]. Dust the surface with more cocoa [18]
to completely cover the cake [19].Pour the cream into a bowl, add the sugar [20] and whip with a mixer [21] until frothy.  
Spread a generous layer of whipped cream on top of the cake [22], sprinkle with a little more cocoa [23] and your brick cake (layered no-bake cake) will be ready to be enjoyed [24]!
