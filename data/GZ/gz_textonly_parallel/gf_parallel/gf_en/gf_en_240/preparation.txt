To prepare pesto lasagna, start with the pesto (for the complete procedure you can see our Genoese pesto recipe): first off, clean the basil leaves with a clean cloth, do not wash them with water. Then take a mortar and pound the peeled garlic together with a pinch of coarse salt: once you have a creamy mixture, add the basil leaves and another pinch of coarse salt [1]. Crush the basil by turning pestle and mortar in the opposite direction [2]. Add the pine nuts and grated cheese as you continue to crush the ingredients. Finally, add the oil [3] a little at a time, continuing to mix the ingredients well with the pestle until you obtain a homogeneous sauce. Alternatively, you can make the pesto in a blender, taking care to cool the blades in the refrigerator first and blend for the shortest possible time to prevent the basil from discoloring.
Set the pesto aside [4]. As an alternative to the mortar, you can proceed with a blender fitted with blades for making pesto. Now proceed with the homemade pasta. Pour the sieved flour into a bowl (keep about 1/4-1/3 cup (30-40 g) to add later if needed) [5]. Add the eggs and start mixing the ingredients with a fork, incorporating the flour a little at a time [6].
Then knead the dough with your hands [7] for at least 10 minutes until a soft and homogeneous mixture is obtained. Shape into a loaf [8], wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest in a cool, dry place for about 30 minutes. Now make the béchamel sauce: heat the milk in a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, then turn off the heat and add the sifted flour a little at a time [9], stirring continuously with a whisk to prevent any lumps. Then put the butter and flour mixture back over low heat and stir until golden.
Season the milk with nutmeg and salt, then pour it a little at a time into the butter and flour mixture [10], stir vigorously with a whisk [11]. Cook for 5-6 minutes on a low heat and continue stirring until the sauce thickens and starts to boil. Your béchamel sauce is ready, transfer it to a bowl and let it cool down [12].
In the meantime, pick up the fresh dough, sprinkle it with very little 00 flour, then divide it into 2 portions; wrap in plastic the one you are not using immediately to prevent it from drying out and put the other through a pasta machine (alternatively you can roll out the dough by hand with a rolling pin), flatten the dough and pass it through the rollers of the machine, from the widest to the thinnest thickness gradually until you get a very thin sheet of dough [13]. From the sheets of dough, cut 22 rectangles measuring 4x6 inches (10x15 cm) with a smooth pastry cutter or a knife [14]. Place the sheets on a tray with flour to prevent them from sticking [15].
Bring a saucepan full of slightly salted water to a boil, blanch the sheets for 1 minute [16], drain them and place them on a tray drizzling them with a little oil so they won't stick [17]. You can also quickly dip the pasta sheets in a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. Once the pasta is cooked, take a 12x8-inch (30x20 cm) ovenproof dish and grease the bottom with a little oil [18].
Spoon a layer of béchamel sauce [19] then one of pesto [20], and lay 3 sheets of pasta on top [21], overlapping them slightly. 
Cover with béchamel sauce [22] and pesto, taking care to distribute the sauces evenly with a spoon [23], sprinkle with grated cheese [24] and repeat with another layer of fresh pasta sheets until the ingredients are used up (you will need 6 layers composed of 3 sheets each).
Finish off the last layer with 4 sheets of dough arranged horizontally (25-26), then top with béchamel sauce and pesto [27].
Mix the sauces well to obtain a more homogeneous cream [28] and finish with a layer of grated cheese [29]. Now bake the pesto lasagna in a preheated static oven at 360°F (180°C) for 15 minutes, then continue for another 5 minutes in grill mode (if you like a softer surface, you can skip this step). Take the pesto lasagna out of the oven and let it cool slightly before taking to the table [30]!
