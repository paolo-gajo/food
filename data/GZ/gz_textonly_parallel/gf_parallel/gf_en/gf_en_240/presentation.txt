Pesto lasagna is a special recipe in which two stars of our cuisine come together harmoniously in a first course of homemade pasta that evokes the flavors of tradition. Layers of handmade egg pasta sheets alternate with a tasty and strong Genoese pesto (basil sauce) to be prepared with the first leaves of basil offered by the season. The b√©chamel sauce, which gives a velvety touch and makes the sheets creamy, is a must in this dish. While a bit time consuming, pesto lasagna is a multiple-step process of homemade preparations that will repay you in terms of taste and the rewarding feeling of having done everything yourself! So dust off the mortar and rolling pin and get to work preparing this delicious summer dish.
