Some say that this recipe originates from Amalfi and the surrounding areas, while others maintain that the name simply represents the Mediterranean flavors that it features. The one certainty is that Amalfi-style stuffed calamari is a tasty fish main course that is perfect for any occasion. We’ve already made stuffed squid in various forms, including with couscous, Andalusian-style with onions and saffron, and with escarole, all succulent variations that have proven to be big hits, and this new recipe is no different. A soft and delicate mixture of potatoes, zucchini, capers, olives, and lemon zest makes the perfect filling for this extremely versatile mollusk. Be sure to have a few slices of bread on hand, too, because you won’t be able to resist mopping up the cooking juice!
