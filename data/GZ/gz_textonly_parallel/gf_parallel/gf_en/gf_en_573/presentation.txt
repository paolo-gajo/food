Where else could baci panteschi come from if not Sicily? Rich, sumptuous, fried and with ricotta cheese, just like the famous Sicilian cannoli! Typical of the Island of Pantelleria, these sweets consist of two crisp pieces of pastry made from a simple batter which is plunged in hot oil using a special iron to create their special shape. BothÂ fritters are held together in an inseparable embrace by a morish ricotta cheese cream flavored with cinnamon. Baci panteschi will be a treat for the palate and the eye!
