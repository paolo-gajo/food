To prepare baci panteschi, start by making the batter: place the flour, the salt [1], the egg [2] and the milk in a bowl [3].
Stir with a whisk [4] to form a smooth batter [5]. Heat abundant oil in a pan and prepare the cream in the meantime: place the ricotta cheese in a bowl, add the sugar [6] and stir with a spoon.
Now add the cinnamon [7] and stir some more [8]. Place in a smooth-tipped pastry bag and leave in the refrigerator. When the oil reaches a temperature of 338-356F, place the iron for making baci panteschi inside it and heat it for around a minute [9].
Dab with some absorbent paper [10] and immerse in the batter without going over the edge. Immerse the iron in the hot oil once more [12].
Wait 1-2 minutes [13] until the fritter is nice and golden [14]. You won't need to dip the iron in the oil again to fry the other fritters because it will already be hot; bear in mind that the next fritters will cook in around a minute. Drain the fritters with a skimmer and place them on a tray lined with parchment paper [15]. Don't worry if the fritters remain stuck to the iron, when they're nice and golden you can remove them with a spoon and place them straight on the tray. Fry all the fritters and leave them to cool.
Take the pastry bag and use it to fill the first fritters [16]: add a circle of cream along the outer edge [17] then one on the inside [18].
Place another fritter on top of it to close it like a sandwich [19]. Fill the rest of the baci panteschi and garnish with abundant powdered sugar [20] before serving them [21]!
