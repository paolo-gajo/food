The classic tiramisu takes a vacation... to make room for a much more summery version, perfect for this season! The cream is still the same, made with eggs and mascarpone, but instead of coffee for soaking the ladyfingers, we've used fruit! After the strawberry version and the mixed berries one, today we want to suggest an even more original idea: apricot tiramisu. This summer fruit pairs perfectly with the mascarpone cream due to its sweetness, but we'll reveal a little trick to enjoy this dessert all year round: use canned apricots to make it even during the winter season. The result will be a refreshing and delightful dessert that encapsulates all the flavor of apricots, embraced by a luscious cream. Give it a try and let yourself be swept away by the fruity whirlwind of this apricot tiramisu!
