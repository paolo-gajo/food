To prepare strozzapreti pasta with cacio cheese, mussels, and pepper, start by making the fresh pasta: Blend the flour with salt [1], gradually adding the water while mixing by hand [2]. Knead until all the ingredients are well combined [3].
Transfer the mixture to a work surface and carry on kneading until the dough is smooth and uniform [4]. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for at least half an hour. Wash the mussels under running water [5], remove the beard [6],
and scrape the shells with a scouring pad to remove any external residue [7]. Add a drizzle of oil and an unpeeled garlic clove to a large pan: Sauté and add the mussels [8]. Turn up the heat and add the wine [9].
Lower the heat, let the alcohol evaporate off, and cover with a lid [10]. Cook for about 5-6 minutes or until the mussels are fully open. Strain the mussels [11], taking care to set aside the cooking liquid [12].
Shell the mussels and set aside [13]. In the meantime, take the dough and divide it in two [14] (keep one portion in the plastic wrap). Roll out the first half to a thickness of a penny (approximately 1 mm) [15].
Cut strips about 1 inch (2 cm) wide with a pasta cutting wheel [16] and form the strozzapreti: Take each strip, place the end of the strip on the palm of one hand and slide your other palm over it to roll it up. Your first strozzapreti will automatically break away from the rest of the strip. Then do the same thing with the rest of the strip. The strozzapreti should be at least an inch (3 cm) long [17]. Carry on in the same way until you’ve used up all the dough and arranged the strozzapreti on lightly floured trays [18].
Heat a large pot of water and add salt when it boils. This will be used to cook the strozzapreti. In the meantime, prepare the pecorino cheese sauce: Add the grated pecorino cheese and 7 oz (200 g) of mussel cooking liquid [19] to a bowl. Mix with a whisk to blend everything [20]. Then add freshly ground black pepper [21] to a large frying pan and toast over medium heat for a few minutes, tossing the pan continually.
Add the mussels and the remaining mussel liquid [22] and cook over low heat. In the meantime, cook the strozzapreti until they’re al dente [23], then drain them and pour straight into the pan with the sauce [24]. Stir over moderate heat.
Add the pecorino sauce [25] and stir continuously using tongs, still over moderate heat. Add the chopped parsley [26] and carry on stirring until the sauce has thickened and blended well with the pasta (at first the sauce might seem too runny, but just keep stirring over medium-low heat. The sauce will combine with the starch in the pasta and take on a creamy consistency). Serve the strozzapreti pasta with cacio cheese, mussels, and pepper [27] piping hot, seasoning with more freshly ground black pepper to taste.
