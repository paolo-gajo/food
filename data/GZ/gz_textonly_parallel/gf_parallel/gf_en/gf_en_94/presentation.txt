All the authenticity of fresh pasta, the spicy tang of pepper, a sprinkling of cacio cheese. These ingredients are wonderful on their own and divine when combined in this wonderfully creamy dish: strozzapreti pasta with cacio cheese, mussels, and pepper. Preparing strozzapreti by hand is very satisfying: All it takes is water, flour, salt, and a little elbow grease. The sauce is then combined with that perennial favorite, cacio and pepper, plus a flavor of the ocean courtesy of mussels, which have to be the tastiest shellfish in existence. Let yourself be seduced by this pasta dish with its strong yet well-balanced flavors. It will become one of your go-to one-pot dishes.
