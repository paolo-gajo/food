To prepare tagliatelle, start by placing the flour in a bowl (use slightly less than the full dose so that you can add more if needed) [1]. Create a well in the center of the flour, break open the eggs at room temperature and place them in the middle. Now beat with a fork [2] and as soon as the eggs absorb a little flour, knead by hand [3]
to obtain a homogeneous dough. Continue kneading the dough on a worktop lightly sprinkled with flour [4] for at least 10-15 minutes to achieve a smooth and elastic consistency [5]. Knead energetically to develop the gluten, but without tearing the dough. Now roll into a ball and envelop in plastic wrap [6]. Leave the dough to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
Split it into three parts [7] so that it is easier to roll out. Sprinkle abundant flour over one piece and flatten it [8]; do not remove the other two pieces from the plastic wrap, otherwise they will dry out. Take the pasta making machine and set it to thickness level 1, the thickest setting, and feed the dough through the rollers [9]
to obtain a thick pasta sheet [10], then fold both edges of the past to the middle, for a more rectangular shape (11-12)
and lightly sprinkle with flour before feeding it through the rollers once more; repeat several times all the way up to thickness setting 8 [13]. Place the resulting sheet of pasta on a pastry board sprinkled with flour, tip the edges using a spatula (or knife) for a more regular-shaped past (14-15)
and split into two pieces [16] so that it is easier to work with. Feed it back into the pasta machine set to 8 [17], as it will have shrunk a little after kneading. Now sprinkle a little semolina on both sides [18], leave the pasta sheets to dry for 5 minutes on each side.
Take a pasta sheet, fold one edge over by around two thirds [19] and start shaping it [20] into a very flat roll, with the closed end up [21]. 
Cut the pasta roll into 0.28 inch (7 mm) thick slices [22]. Pick up the tagliatelle by both ends [23] and spread them out on your hand [24];
now roll them around your fingers to create a nest and place on a pastry board lightly sprinkled in flour (25-26). Continue until you finish all the dough. Your tagliatelle are ready, all you need to do now is cook them [27].
