Along with orecchiette, trofie and fusilli, tagliatelle are one of the most delicious and well-known pasta shapes of Italian cuisine. According to tradition, this delicacy is typical of the city of Bologna, where tagliatelle are usually prepared with the unmissable ragu bolognese. Despite being a typical recipe of Emilia, tagliatelle are widespread in other regions too, including in the Marche and Veneto, and they are also perfect for serving with other condiments: mushrooms, truffle or a simple fresh tomato sauce for example! There are also more rustic versions, like the egg-free one, prepared with nothing but water and semolina. Tagliatelle are a veritable institution: on 16th April 1972, the Confraternita del Tortellino and the Accademia Italiana della Cucina jointly registered the authentic recipe and size of the original "Tagliatella di Bologna" to the Bologna Chamber of Commerce. Tagliatelle were assigned a special size: 8 mm (0.31 inches) wide when cooked, and around 7 mm (0.28 inches) uncooked (12,1270th of the Asinelli Tower, the symbolic monument of Bologna). There is no definitive ruling as to the thickness of this kind of fresh pasta, although experts have ruled that it should be between 6 and 8 tenths of a millimeter. We faithfully prepared traditional tagliatelle according to these instructions, while leaving the choice of condiment entirely up to you!
