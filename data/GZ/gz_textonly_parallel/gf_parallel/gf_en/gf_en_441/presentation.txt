It's Sunday morning and you want to prepare breakfast for the whole family but you have run out of eggs? No problem, there is a solution to everything! And what we propose is called: egg-free pancakes! Soft and fragrant, they are prepared in no time because you will not need to beat the egg whites until stiff, unlike classic pancakes. They are excellent to be enjoyed with maple syrup, creams, jams, honey or fresh fruit! After tasting these egg-free pancakes, discover other variations such as protein pancakes, light pancakes, pancakes without butter and yeast-free pancakes, for a different breakfast every weekend!
