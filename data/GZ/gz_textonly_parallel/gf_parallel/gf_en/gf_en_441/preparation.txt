To make egg-free pancakes, first melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool. Meanwhile, pour the flour into a bowl and add the sifted baking powder [1], sugar [2] and milk [3].
Mix everything, and add salt [4], the melted butter [5] and the vanilla extract [6]. Stir again to obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture.
Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat and grease it with butter [7]. Pour a small ladle of batter into the center [8] and spread it slightly with the back of a spoon to make a round shape [9].
When bubbles begin to appear on the surface, turn the pancake with a spatula [10] and cook for a minute on the other side too [11]. The total cooking time is about 3 minutes. As they are cooked, stack the egg-free pancakes on a plate and garnish with your favorite ingredients [12]!
