To make the passatelli in broth, start by making a good meat broth. While it’s cooking, turn to the dough for the passatelli: Zest one lemon, being careful not to remove the more bitter white part [1] as well. Beat the eggs in a bowl for a few moments together with a pinch of salt [2]. In a larger bowl, combine the breadcrumbs (better if they’re grated from dry bread) and grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese [3].
Versate anche la farina, aromatizzate con la scorza di limone [4] e la noce moscata grattugiata [5]. Unite le uova [6].
Mix the ingredients, using a spatula at first [7], then by hand. You’ll have to work the mixture for a while to get a compact and elastic little mound of dough [8]. You can use it immediately or let it rest for 10-15 minutes wrapped in plastic wrap [9].
Take one piece of the dough at a time and place it in a potato ricer fitted with the coarse disc (holes at least 1/4” (5 mm) in diameter) [10], pressing the dough out directly into the broth, which should be boiling gently (not rapidly) [11]. Use a knife to cut the passatelli as they come out through the potato ricer, to a length of around 2-2? inches (5-6 cm) [12].
Cook the passatelli very briefly [13], only until they rise to the surface, and then place them directly in individual dishes or a soup tureen [14]. Serve the passatelli piping hot [15], with a little more grated Parmigiano Reggiano and some freshly ground black pepper on top if you’d like!
