The origins of passatelli in broth lie in Emilia Romagna, a region where you can really eat well and that’s the birthplace of many recipes prepared by hand, such as fresh egg pasta. This is a first course dish that goes back to medieval times, as mentioned in the information held by the Accademia Italiana di Cucina (Italian Culinary Academy), with which the recipe is registered. Although the proportions of the main ingredients used in this recipe (egg, parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs) stay more or less the same among the different areas of Emilia, Romagna, and Marche, there are some nuances: Some people use a pinch of flour to adjust the dough, like we’ve done; some add flavor only using lemon zest, while others only use a sprinkling of nutmeg, or both lemon and nutmeg. Maybe you even have your own traditional and family recipes for passatelli in broth, made using the special tool that generations have used to pass on the technique for mashing and dragging the dough, with a good rhythm and lots of patience! We’re going to show you how to do it with a potato ricer (fitted with the coarse disc), a really easy method that anyone can do and that will give you handmade passatelli to serve in a tasty meat broth as a perfect addition to your menu on Christmas Day, December 26th (when a dish in broth is traditionally eaten), or New Year’s Eve!
