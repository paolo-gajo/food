To prepare peperonata, wash and dry the peppers. Then slice them lengthwise, all around the core [1], remove the white filaments and reduce them to thin layers [2]. Peel and slice the onions [3].
Pour a drizzle of oil and the whole garlic cloves into a large pan [4]. Heat and add the onions [5]. Stew the onions over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. When they are softened and have released their water [6],
pour in the peppers [7]. Add salt [8] and pepper, then stir [9]
and cover with a lid [10]: cook the peppers for another 15 minutes over medium heat. The peppers will be softened [11], remove the cloves of garlic, and pour in the tomato puree [12],
stir [13] and cook for another 15 minutes with the lid on [14]. Once cooked, your peperonata is ready to be enjoyed [15] hot, warm or even cold to accompany meat, fish or cheese dishes!
