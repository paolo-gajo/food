Peperonata (pepper and onion stew) is a very tasty summer side dish that is ideal to pair with delicate meats or fish. There is also a regional Umbrian variant of peperonata, a homemade and very genuine recipe: the "bandiera" or flag. But peppers are loved all over the country, and the way this summer dish is prepared varies from place to place. Perfect on hot bruschetta, peperonata is even good served as a sauce in pasta!
