Time for breakfast: coffee, orange juice and... banana bread! A soft and tasty dessert with banana and cinnamon. This rich dessert, which originated in the US, is also perfect for brunch, lightly heated in the oven and served with butter and jams, or for a hearty snack. The scent will spread into the kitchen while cooking and, once ready, slice after slice will disappear in a flash! Quick and easy to prepare, much like the banana and peanut donuts or banana and yogurt cake, it is a great way to use the bananas that are often forgotten in the fruit basket, too ripe to be enjoyed. Try our version of banana bread and enhance it as desired with chocolate chips, coarsely chopped nuts or hazelnuts. It'll taste even better!
