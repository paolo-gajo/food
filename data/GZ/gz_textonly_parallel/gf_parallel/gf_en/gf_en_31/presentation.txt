Veggie balls are a tasty second course dish from the rustic cucina povera tradition that are also great as a crowd-pleasing appetizer: crunchy golden morsels with a tasty and colorful seasonal vegetable filling held together by cheese, eggs, and breadcrumbs, like in the best tradition of our grandmothers, who sometimes even used them to stuff meatloaf. In fact, fried veggie balls have a long tradition in Italian home cooking: a way to bring a tasty dish to the table that can be made from just a few rustic ingredients; a mothers’ trick to get their children to eat vegetables... We all have memories related to this dish, one bite of which has the power to bring us back to our childhood. While less healthy and more expensive dishes were the trend for a while, we’re now going back to a cultural climate where there’s more awareness of the need to reduce food waste, rediscovering authentic dishes that make the most of what’s at hand. So, even though our recipe shows you a “basic” version of these veggie balls, with carrot, potato, and zucchini, we suggest going back to the recipe every once in a while and changing things up with whatever vegetables the garden (and fridge) can offer you, depending on the season. In the fall, for example, why not try making our mushroom balls? That’s how these balls come about, and there’s no better or more authentic way to make them and enjoy them.
