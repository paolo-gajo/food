To make the veggie balls, first put a pot filled with cold salted water on the stove and immerse the potatoes after having washed them carefully [1]. Let them cook for 30-40 minutes, then peel them while they’re still warm and pass them through a potato ricer [2] into a large bowl [3].
Next, chop the onion [4], trim the carrots and cut them into ¼-inch dice [5]. Then cut the zucchini into dice of the same size [6].
Crush the garlic using the blade of a knife [7] and chop the parsley finely [8]. Place a large saucepan on the stove and then add some oil and the crushed garlic clove. Once the oil has been infused with the garlic flavor, add the chopped onion [9]. 
Leave it to cook for a couple of minutes, then add the carrot and, a minute later, the peas [10]. Finally, add the zucchini [11] and salt and pepper [12] to taste.
Let it cook for around 10 minutes, making sure that the vegetables stay slightly crunchy [13]. Stir well and leave to cool. Now take the bowl with the mashed potato and add the grated Parmigiano cheese [14] and egg, lightly beaten [15]. 
Season with salt [16], pepper, and nutmeg [17]. Pour in the vegetables once they’ve cooled [18]. 
Finally, add the chopped parsley [19]. Combine well with a spoon [20] to get a mixture with the right consistency to work with [21]. 
Moisten your hands and shape the veggie balls, using about 2 oz (50 g) of mixture for each one [22]. Transfer the balls one by one to a tray lined with parchment paper [23]. Once you’ve formed all the balls, move on to the breading. Beat the eggs in one bowl and pour the breadcrumbs into another. Now dip each veggie ball into the egg [24].
Once it’s well covered in egg, dredge in the breadcrumbs [25]. Transfer the veggie balls to another tray as you finish breading them [26]. Next, fry the veggie balls in plenty of peanut oil, pre-heated to 350°F (180°C), immersing them a few at a time [27]. 
When they’re nice and golden, drain the veggie balls [28] and transfer them to a tray lined with paper towel [29], then salt them to taste. Your veggie balls are ready – enjoy them piping hot [30]!
