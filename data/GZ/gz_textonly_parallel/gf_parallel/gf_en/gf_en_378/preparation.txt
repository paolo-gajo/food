To prepare insalata russa (Italian-style coleslaw) first put the eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and cook for 9 minutes from when the water starts boiling [1]. Once cooked, put them in a bowl with water to cool. Meanwhile, peel carrots and potatoes and cut them into 1/5-inch (1/2 cm) [2] [3] cubes.
Take a large saucepan to steam the vegetables: first add the potatoes and cook for 10 minutes [4], then add the peas and cook for another 7-10 minutes [5]. Finally add the carrots, cover with the lid and cook for another 5-7 minutes [6].
Now shell the eggs [7] and dice them too [8]. When the vegetables are cooked [9], transfer them to a bowl and let them cool down.
Add the hard boiled eggs to your warm vegetables [10], then season with salt, pepper, oil [11] and apple cider vinegar [12]. Stir gently and let it cool.
Meanwhile prepare the mayonnaise: put the yolks in a bowl, add salt [13], pepper and white wine vinegar [14], then start working with an electric mixer [15].
Pour the vegetable oil in a thin stream, taking care to do it very slowly to prevent mayonnaise from breaking [16]. When the mixture is whipped, add lemon juice [16] and whisk it again until the desired consistency is obtained [18].
Pour the mayonnaise into the vegetables and mix everything together [19]. Let the insalata russa (Italian-style coleslaw) rest in the fridge for at least one hour [20] before serving and enjoying it [21]!
