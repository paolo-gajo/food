Ricotta and chocolate fritters is a fried dessert, usually prepared during Carnival, with a sheep's milk ricotta cheese and chocolate drops filling. The chocolate flavor paired up so well with ricotta cheese, makes these ricotta and chocolate fritters a delicious dessert, so flavorsome and impossible to resist. The soft center of these sweet fritters, wrapped in a crisp, golden pastry, makes then truly irresistible. While usually served during Carnival, ricotta and chocolate fritters are also great for other occasions, like parties and birthdays.
