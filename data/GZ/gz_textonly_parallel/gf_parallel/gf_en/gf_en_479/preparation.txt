To make the chocolate magic cake, make sure all ingredients are at the indicated temperatures: take the eggs out of the fridge and separate the yolks from the whites, then melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool down. Also, heat the milk which will need to be at a temperature of around 104° F. Sift the flour and the unsweetened cocoa powder in a bowl [1], mix well [2] and set aside. Finally, butter and line a 9 inch square tray with parchment paper. Now you are ready to prepare the batter: pour the yolks at room temperature into the bowl of a planetary mixer fitted with a whisk and beat at medium-high speed, adding the sugar little by little [3].
After around 5-6 minutes the mixture will become clear and frothy; gradually add the cold water [4], the vanilla extract [5] and the salt [6].
Now add the cooled melted butter [7] and stir for a few more moments; set the mixer to minimum speed and add the mixture of powders (flour and cocoa), one spoon at a time [8]. Once the powders are incorporated, gradually add the lukewarm milk [9].
Now take the egg whites and start beating them using an electric whisk in a separate bowl; add the lemon juice [10]: the egg whites should be semi-whipped, so frothy yet soft [11]. Pour the egg whites into the bowl with the cocoa mixture [12].
Evenly incorporate the egg whites by delicately stirring them in with a whisk [13]: the final mixture will be very fluid, almost liquid. Pour the resulting mixture into a previously lined mold [14] and bake in a static over preheated to 302°F for around 80 minutes [15].
Once baked [16], the cake should be firm on the surface and creamy in the middle, so check the consistency using a toothpick, to make sure it still isn't liquid. Leave to cool in the mold before covering with plastic wrap and leaving it in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 2 hours [17]. Once this time is up, remove the cake from the mold and trim the edges using a damp knife or a nylon string, then divide it into cubes and sprinkle with powdered sugar to taste: your chocolate magic cake is ready to be served [18]!
