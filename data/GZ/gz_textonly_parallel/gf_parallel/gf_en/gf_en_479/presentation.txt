If you've already discovered, fallen in love with, tried, and tried again the classic magic cake, you simply can’t pass up its delightful chocolate version! By substituting a portion of the flour with unsweetened cocoa powder, you’ll create a dessert that's just as astonishing. With a single batter, you will, in fact, achieve three layers of distinct textures: a spongy top layer, a creamier middle, and a bottom layer reminiscent of flan. Here, too, for the magic to unfold, the ingredients must be added in a precise sequence and at the specified temperature. No magic wand necessary – just a keen eye for detail. And as for your guests, well, they don’t need to know the secret behind the magic... Are you ready to wow them with an incredible chocolate magic cake?
