To prepare spinach and ricotta bites, start by heating the oil with a whole garlic clove [1]; add the previously washed spinach and saut? on a high flame for 5-6 minutes; stir frequently [2] to sweat thoroughly [3].
Remove the garlic [4] and drain the spinach in a colander: press down lightly with a spatula to remove the excess water and leave to cool [5]; once cold, coarsely chop them with a knife [6].
Now place the ricotta cheese in a bowl (drain any excess water beforehand) and stir with a spoon [7]; add the spinach and the grated cheese [8] salt and pepper to taste, and stir [9].
For added consistency, add the breadcrumbs [10] and continue to mix [11]. As soon as the mixture is ready you can make the balls. Take some of the mixture, around 1 1/3 tbsp, and shape by hand [12];
you should end up with 24-26 small balls [13]. Delicately dip each one in a bowl in which you will have beaten the eggs with salt and pepper [14] and then in another bowl with the breadcrumbs [15].
Continue in this way until you finish them all and place them on an oven tray lined with parchment paper (16-17). Bake the spinach and ricotta cheese balls in a static oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for around 20 minutes. Serve them piping hot!
