To prepare the rustici leccesi first make the béchamel: Heat the milk in a saucepan and melt the butter separately in another saucepan over low heat [1], add the flour [2] and stir quickly with a whisk to prevent any lumps from forming [3].
When all the flour has been incorporated, add the warm milk [4], and let the sauce thicken over medium heat while still stirring [5]. Flavor with nutmeg [6], 
season with salt [7], and then cover the béchamel with plastic wrap [8] in contact with the surface. Slice the mozzarella and then chop finely [9]. If the mozzarella is too wet, leave it to dry in a colander.
Add a drizzle of oil [10] and salt [11] to the tomato puree. Use a 4-inch (10 cm) food ring mold [12]
to cut 16 discs from the puff pastry sheet and another 8 discs using a 3-inch (8 cm) food ring mold (13-14). Place 8 of the larger discs on a baking tray lined with parchment paper [15], 
brush the surface with beaten egg [16] and place another disc of the same size on top [17]. This operation will ensure the pastry puffs upwards and makes the rustici leccesi rise. Place a generous teaspoonful of béchamel in the middle of the disc [18], 
then a teaspoonful of tomato puree [19] and a little chopped mozzarella cheese [20]. Brush the edges with egg [21] 
and cover the larger disc with the smaller ones [22], pressing with your fingers to seal the edges [23]. Do the same for all the other rustici leccesi and then brush on more beaten egg [24].
The rustici leccesi are now ready to cook [25]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 400°F (200°C) for about 20 minutes, until they are golden brown [26]. Once ready, take your rustici leccesi out of the oven and let them cool before serving [27]!
