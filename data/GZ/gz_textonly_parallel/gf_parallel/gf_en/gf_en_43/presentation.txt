How to surprise your partner on this day dedicated to celebrating love? Some simple cookies, or a scenographic heart-shaped cake? This time the answer lies in a tart: the Valentine's Day tart! What makes it even better than a classic jam tart? The goodness is similar, but the effect is truly special, thanks to the original decoration. Use the left over shortcrust dough to make heart shapes of various sizes, instead of the more traditional lozenge pattern, and place them on the strawberry jam. This choice is no coincidence, as the color contrast with the red will make your message of love stand out even more! What are you waiting for? Have fun personalizing your Valentine's Day tart and send us your most romantic photos.
