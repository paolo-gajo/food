To make Valentine's Day tart, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry: place the flour 00 and the cold butter in the bowl of a planetary mixer with a leaf spatula [1] and switch it on for around 2 minutes to obtain a sandy consistency; add the nut flour [2] and the powdered sugar [3].
Switch the planetary mixer back on for a couple of minutes, then add the eggs at room temperature [4], the salt [5], and the grated lemon peel [6].
Stir the ingredients for another 2 minutes until firm [7], then place the dough on a work top and shape into a single piece to prevent the gluten from over-developing, which would compromise the crumbliness of the shortcrust pastry [8]. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap [9] and leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
Once the resting time is up, roll the dough out on a work top lightly sprinkled with flour, until around 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) thick [10]. Cut the shortcrust pastry out with a 8.3 x 8.3 inch (21 x 21 cm) square mold [11], then place it on an oven tray lined with parchment paper, together with the mold [12].
Cut the left over shortcrust dough into strips that are 2 inches (5 cm) wide [13] and stick them to the edge of the mold [14], then remove any excess dough [15]. Place the oven tray with the shortcrust pastry shell in the refrigerator and prepare the decorations.
Knead the left over shortcrust dough once more [16] and roll it out until around 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) thick, then cut circles out using a 2.4 inch (6 cm) diameter shaping ring mold [17]. Place the circles on a tray, then leave in the refrigerator for 5 minutes [18].
In the meantime, remove the shortcrust dough shell from the refrigerator and fill with the strawberry jam [19]. Trim the edge of the tart with a knife [20] so that it is 0.4 inches (1 cm) taller than the strawberry jam layer [21]: in this way the jam will not leak out during baking.
Now remove the shortcrust dough circles from the refrigerator and cut the middle of each one out using a 1.6 inch (4 cm) heart-shaped ring mold and a 1.2 inch (3 cm) one [22]. Place the shapes on the jam, alternating both sizes [24]. Bake the tart in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for around 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool thoroughly [24], the sprinkle with the powdered sugar. The Valentine's Day tart is ready to be cut into small squares and enjoyed with the one you love!
