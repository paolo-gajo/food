To make the coffee puff pastry, first put the ricotta cheese in a sieve so it will lose its whey and not be too moist. Let it drain for at least an hour. Prepare the full-bodied coffee, add sugar, [1] then let it cool. Make the cream: in a bowl, pour the very cold heavy cream [2] and whip it stiff with a hand mixer [3].
Once the ricotta is dry, transfer it to a bowl [4], add the powdered sugar, [5] and stir [6]. 
to obtain a homogeneous compound [7]. Once the coffee has cooled, add it to the ricotta cream [8], stir to mix well and then add the chocolate chips [9].
At this point add the whipped cream a little at a time, gently so as not to let it go flat [10]. Cover with plastic wrap [11] and place in the refrigerator to firm, and in the meantime make the the pastry. In the meantime, roll out the pastry [12]
and cut with a knife into 16 equal parts [13]. Brush the surface with melted butter [14] and sprinkle with granulated sugar [15], this way the pastry will remain crunchy when in contact with the cream.
Now slightly distance the rectangles so that they do not stick together and make holes in the dough with the tines of a fork [16] so that it does not swell too much during cooking. Cook in a ventilated oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 10 minutes. Once cooked, remove [17] and let cool. Meanwhile, take the cream from the refrigerator [18].
Pour it into a pastry bag without a nozzle (19-20), then squeeze the cream on a puff pastry [21], so as to cover it completely.
Then close with another puff pastry [22] and sprinkle the surface with powdered sugar [23]. The coffee puff pastry is ready to be served [24]!
