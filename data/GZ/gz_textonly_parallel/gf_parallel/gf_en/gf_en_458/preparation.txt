To make the colomba cake, first take the dove and cut it into slices [1], and into small cubes [2], take half of them (220 g) and pour them into a bowl with milk [3] , set aside the remaining part that will be used to decorate the top of your cake.
Moisten the colomba cubes with your hands and keep them aside [4]. Grease a 24 cm diameter tart mold [5] and pour the cubes soaked in milk here [6]
distribute them on the pan pressing with the back of the spoon [7]. Now take care of the filling: in a bowl pour the well-drained ricotta, icing sugar [8], mix everything with a fork, and add the egg [9]
mix well to obtain a homogeneous cream [10]. With a spatula spread the cream obtained over the cake [11], then distribute the remaining 220 g of chopped colomba over the entire surface (12-13).
Chop the dark chocolate [14], distribute it on the cake and finally add a layer of chopped hazelnuts [15].
The colomba cake is ready for cooking [16], bake in a preheated conventional oven at 355°F (180°C) for 25 minutes. Once it appears slightly golden on the surface, take it out of the oven [17], let it cool then turn it out on a plate and serve [18].
