Unmissable on Easter tables, colomba is one of the traditional Easter sweets loved for its exquisite simplicity: as soon as you discard the wrapping that holds it, you are enveloped in a vanilla scent of baked cake which is really difficult to resist. Each slice is precious so what is left over is always kept to make other exquisite delights such as the colomba tiramisù, a tantalizing reinterpretation of the classic tiramisù, a fresh semifreddo, or a rustic-flavored cake like the one we offer in this preparation. The typical Easter form of the dessert gives way to a more classic cake, hiding a "secret" ingredient. A creamy filling will be the most delicious of discoveries at the first bite and everything will be made even more inviting by a layer of chocolate and a shower of crunchy hazelnut grains. No leftover has ever been so tasty, try it to believe it!
