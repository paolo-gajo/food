To make the chocolate pudding, first roughly chop the dark chocolate [1]. Pour the milk into a small pan and heat it [2]; in the meantime, put the butter cut into pieces in another saucepan, melt over low heat and add the sugar [3].
Add the chopped dark chocolate [4] and mix with a whisk. When the chocolate is melted, add the sifted flour [5], a little at a time, and keep mixing well [6].
Pour the boiling milk all at once into the chocolate mixture [7] and cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens (8-9). Let it simmer for 5 minutes and turn off the burner.
Pour the pudding into a single mold [10], let it cool and put it in the fridge and cool for at least two hours. Meanwhile, whip the creamÂ and slice the strawberries. When the pudding is firm, place it on a serving plate and decorate with tufts of whipped cream on the sides [11] and top before garnishing with strawberry slices as you like! Now you have your chocolate pudding with cream and strawberries!
