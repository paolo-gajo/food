We have always loved pies: versatile and easy to make, they are the perfect solution for rustling up a last minute meal with few ingredients! With cauliflower and fennel in the winter and cherry tomatoes and eggplants in the summer, these delicious pies can be prepared all year round, by adding seasonal vegetables to the filling of the delicious recipe. At the table they can be served as a starter, perhaps cut into small and practical squares, or as a rich second course, for a perfect vegetarian option, just like the recipe we'll present to you now: spinach pie. A shell of crumbly shortcrust pastry with a soft filling enriched by sauteed spinach. Without a doubt this is one of the most more'ish ways to enjoy vegetables!
