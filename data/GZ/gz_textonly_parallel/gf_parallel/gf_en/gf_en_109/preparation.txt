To make spinach pie, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry dough: place the flour and cold diced butter in a bowl [1], knead with your finger tips to obtain a crumbly consistency [2] and add the salt [3].
Add the pepper [4], then gradually add the cold water [5], continue mixing all the while to obtain a smooth dough [6].
Place it on a pastry board and shape into a dough loaf. Wrap it in plastic wrap [8] and leave to firm up in the refrigerator for around 1 hour. In the meantime, tip the spring onion and cut into slices [8]. Add a drizzle of oil to a pan, followed by the spring onion and leave to brown for a couple of minutes [9].
Now add the washed spinach [10]; cover with the lid [11] and cook for 5 minutes [12].
Once cooked, add salt and pepper [13]. Leave to one side. Take the shortcrust pastry dough loaf and roll it out on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour [14] until a thin layer is formed [12].
Butter an 8" (22 cm) diameter pie pan. Place the dough over it using a rolling pin [16] and make sure it adheres to the bottom and sides; now cut away any excess dough [17]. The base for the savory pie is ready [18].
Now prepare the filling: place the eggs and cream in the bowl of a mixer [19]. Blend with an immersion mixer [20]. Finely dice the cheese [21].
Place half of the spinach on the shortcut pastry base [22]. Add the cream sauce [23] followed by the diced cheese [24].
Now add the thyme leaves [25] and remaining spinach [26], evenly distributed over the base [27].
Roll out the remaining shortcut pastry dough and cut into strips that are around 0.8 inches (2 cm) wide [28]. Decorate the pie with these strips, forming lozenges [29] and bake in a static oven preheated to 360°F (180°C) for 55 minutes. Once baked, remove your spinach pie [30] and leave to cool before removing from the pan and serving.
