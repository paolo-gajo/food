Cassata, a product of Sicilian pastry-making, and more specifically of Palermo, deserves the place of honor among the typical sweets of this region, together with cannoli, almond pastries and pizzicotti; cassata was created to celebrate Easter after the penance of Lent, but has since become a common dish throughout the year. Cassata is just one of the many Easter sweets that celebrate this festivity. Its decorations are baroque and sumptuous, and its origin is actually Arabic: its name comes from the Arabic word "Quas'at", which means big and round bowl. The richness of its ingredients reflects the characteristics of Arab cuisine, which loves to harmonize contrasting flavors, such as sponge cake filled with ricotta cheese mixed with sugar and chocolate. Apparently simple to make, the preparation ofÂ Sicilian cassata actually requires a lot of skill, especially to create the elaborate decorations with which it is richly endowed.
