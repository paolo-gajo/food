To make your pasta allo scarpariello, start by heating a saucepan with water to cook the pasta. Once the water is boiling, add a little salt. Take the Datterino tomatoes, wash them and slice them in half [1], then take the long fresh chili pepper, trim it and open it up to remove the seeds [2], before slicing it into strips and chopping it [3].
Grate the Pecorino Romano [4] and Parmigiano cheeses. Pour the extra virgin olive oil into a large pot and heat. Add the chopped chili and the whole peeled garlic so it will be easier to remove [5]. Fry for around 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the datterino tomatoes [6], and cook over medium heat for around 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil the spaghetti [7] until it is cooked al dente. Once the tomato sauce is ready, season with salt, remove the garlic [8], and add some of the basil leaves [9]. Add a ladleful of cooking water to create a delicious creamy texture.
Drain the spaghetti, keeping a couple of ladlefuls of cooking water aside, and pour the pasta directly into the pot with the sauce [10]. Finish cooking in the pan over medium-low heat, mixing the spaghetti into the sauce and adding cooking water [11] if necessary, so that the sauce is creamy. Turn off the heat and add the grated Pecorino and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses [12] in several stages, alternating them with more cooking water as needed
and stirring constantly so the cheese doesnâ€™t go stringy [13]. Flavor again with some basil leaves [14]. Serve the pasta allo scarpariello immediately, adding more fresh basil to each plate [15].
