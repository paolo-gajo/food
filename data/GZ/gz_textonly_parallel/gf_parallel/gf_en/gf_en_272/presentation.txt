A super-quick pasta dish featuring cherry tomatoes, cheese and plenty of fresh basil. The recipe for pasta allo scarpariello, a quick and tasty pasta dish that is deep-rooted in Neapolitan tradition, emerged decades ago in the alleyways of the Quartieri Spagnoli district in Naples. These were the days of the scarpari, or old shoemakers, who were sometimes paid for their craftsmanship with whatever their customers had in their pantries. That’s how this quick and tasty dish with a simple and authentic sauce was born, using whatever pieces of cheese were available, the tomato sauce left over from the day before (the Neapolitan ragù), and some basil leaves. The practice of making pasta allo scarpariello with fresh tomatoes has come to be “accepted” over the years, and here we make it with Datterino tomatoes that are left to cook gently and seasoned with Pecorino and Parmigiano cheese that will really envelope the spaghetti for a deliciously creamy sauce. Pasta allo scarpariello is a real treat for the taste buds, thanks mainly to the quality of the ingredients used. In some parts of Campania, it’s also made with scialatielli pasta and yellow tomatoes. For an even heartier version, however, we recommend making it with ziti lardiati, made with ziti pasta, tomato, and, of course, lard!
