If you believe that Saturday evenings in Naples are all about Margherita pizza and fried pizza then you've got it all wrong.Â There's another street food: Neapolitan Panuozzo, typical of the city of Gragnano. This municipality is renowned for the production of bronze die cut pasta and this very special baked product. Basically you could say that Neapolitan panuozzo is a sort of ciabatta bread, baked in a wood oven and filled with a variety of ingredients. People wait their turn in long queues, just to sit down and enjoy this delicacy in the company of friends and relatives who gather for this ritual of pure end enjoyable conviviality. With our homemade version of panuozzo, we guarantee you will bring a touch of genuine Neapolitan tradition to your table, so be sure to gather your nearest and dearest and pair this delicacy with the typical wine of Gragnano... even if you don't have a freezing cold glass, everything will be fine all the same! We present you with a simple filling: tomato, rocket and stracciatella cheese, but give your imagination free rein and try lots of different fillings: ham and cheese, or sausage and turnip greens, for example!
