To prepare Neapolitan panuozzo, start with the dough. Place the manitoba and 00 flours in a bowl [1], add the yeast [2] and the sugar [3].
Stir [4]. Now gradually add part of the water [5] and start kneading. After adding around half, add the salt too [6]. 
Add the remaining water [7] and continue to knead until the flour absorbs the water. Place the dough on a pastry board [8] and knead for a few more minutes [9]. 
You should make a smooth dough [10]: you can still add a pinch of flour, just remember you need to make a soft ball, so not too firm. Place it in a bowl greased with oil [11]; cover with plastic wrap and leaven to double its size [12], which should take 4-5 hours.
Now place it on a pastry board [13]. Divide the dough in half [14]. Take one half and fold it by bringing the outermost edges of the dough inwards to the middle [15]. 
Rotate the dough and repeat the same procedure [16]. Now round the dough [17] and try to achieve an elongated shape. Pierce the underside to thoroughly seal both ends [18]. 
Place it on a tray with parchment paper, with the sealed part down [19], cover with plastic wrap [20] and leaven once more for half an hour or so. In the meantime, season the puree with salt and oil [21]. 
Cut the thoroughly washed tomatoes into four pieces [22] and place them in a bowl [23]. Heat a refractory stone in the oven set to 482°F. Place the stone on a grill on the penultimate shelf from the top, because during baking the panuozzo will grow and may stick to the roof of the oven if too high up. If you don't have a refractory stone, heat an oven tray. Once the leavening time is up, you'll notice that the dough pieces will have grown nicely. 
Place the first piece of dough in a container with the semolina [25] and turn it over [26]. Place it on the pastry board [27].
Now pull and delicately press the dough by hand into a strip that is around 12" long and 4" wide [28]. Place the dough on a paddle and then on the hot refractory stone. Bake at 482°F for around 12 minutes, be sure not to burn it. Remove from the oven when nice and golden [30].
Cut it in half [31], be careful not to burn yourself with the steam as it rises. Fill the base with half of the puree [33]. 
Add half of the cherry tomatoes too [34]. Place both pieces of bread back in the oven for a minute [35]. Remove from the oven and add the rocket [36].
Now add the stracciatella cheese [37] and close the panuozzo [38]. Cut in half and serve [39].
