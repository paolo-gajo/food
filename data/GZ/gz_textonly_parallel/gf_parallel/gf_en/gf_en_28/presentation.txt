There is so much fruit available in the summer! We all have our favorite, we can all agree that watermelon is a big hit with everyone! Synonymous with conviviality and cheer, watermelon is the star of the summer season and source of inspiration for this cocktail we have created just for you: watermelon caipiroska. A reinterpretation of the well-known strawberry caipiroska, this fresh and thirst-quenching version will win you over! Whether you are on the beach around a bonfire with someone strumming on a guitar, or on the veranda at home, watermelon caipiroska is the perfect cocktail for serving... especially straight from an actual watermelon bowl!
