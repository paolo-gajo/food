To prepare watermelon caipiroska, start by removing both tips from the fruit. Pay particular attention as one of the sides will be the base for the container, so be sure to slice it evenly and precisely [1]. Now cut a bigger slice off to remove the other tip; keep it separated [2]. Use a spoon to remove the inside of the watermelon and place all the pieces in a container [3].
Thoroughly remove the inside, eliminate all the seeds and any white strings in the pulp; if you prefer, you can use a lightly dampened cloth. Smooth the inside surfaces [4], cover the container with some plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator [5]. Place all the watermelon pulp in a juicer [6]
switch it on and position a container beneath it, to collect the extracted juice [7]. Weigh the juice and add an equal amount of vodka to it [8]. Take the watermelon and cut a hole into it using a sharp utensil, like a corer or a blade [9].
This will be the hole into which the tap will be positioned, so make sure it is quite low down [10]. Fit the tap, or spout inside the watermelon, be sure to check it is not blocked with pulp and if this is the case, unblock it [11]. Add the watermelon juice mixed with the vodka to your container with a tap [12].
Now prepare the muddled base of the cocktail by cutting the lime in half. Use half a lime for each glass you prepare: cut each half in two [13] and add to tumblers [14]. Add the brown sugar and crush it using a pestle [15].
Add the lemon juice to the glass [16], place the glass under the watermelon container, fill with watermelon juice and vodka inside the tumbler [17], then mix [18].
To decorate each glass, scoop 3 small spheres of pulp out of the leftover tip of watermelon for each glass [19], take a wooden skewer and spear one slice of lime, followed by the watermelon spheres [20]. Lastly, garnish your watermelon caipiroska with 6 ice cubes per glass and the skewer with the slice of lime and three watermelon spheres [21]!
