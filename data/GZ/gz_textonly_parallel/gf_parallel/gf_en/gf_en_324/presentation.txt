The Negroni is one of the most famous Italian cocktails in the world: it has an unmistakable taste and is served in a low, ice-filled tumbler, with a fragrant slice of orange. The origin of this cocktail is all Italian: it seems that at the beginning of the 1920s, Count Camillo Negroni, a charming cosmopolitan and a regular at the aristocratic Caff√® Casoni in Florence, returning from one of his trips to London, asked barman Fosco Scarselli for "a splash of gin" instead of soda in his Americano. The "usual" of the count soon became known by the name of its famous inventor. Today, the Negroni is considered a symbol of the Italian aperitif and, thanks to its simple and balanced taste, is among the most popular cocktails along with other great classics such as the Spritz or Americano.
