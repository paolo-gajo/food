To make the puff pastry, first start by making the base dough known as détrempe. Dissolve the salt in the water in a small jug, stirring with a teaspoon [1] as you do so. Next, pour the cake flour into the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached [2], and add the water and salt [3]. 
Turn on the mixer [4] and leave it to work for a few minutes. This won’t take long as you don’t need a very pliable dough. Once you’ve achieved a smooth consistency [5], use your hands to roll the dough around inside the bowl to clean it [6].
The détrempe shouldn’t stick to your hands [7]. Transfer it to a shallow bowl and press it down with your hands. Cover with plastic wrap [8] and leave to rest at room temperature. Now move on to the beurrage. Dice the butter and place it, along with the cake flour [9], into the
same bowl of the stand mixer [10]. Turn on the mixer, with the dough hook attached [11], and wait a few minutes until the butter has completely absorbed the flour. Take care not to work the mixture too much, otherwise, the butter will get too hot, and what you need is a compact mixture with no lumps [12].
Transfer it to a lightly floured surface and use your hands and a little flour [13] to very quickly shape it into a square [14], before transferring it to a lightly floured casserole dish. Cover with plastic wrap [15] and allow to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. If it’s become too soft, however, place it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. 
Once the beurrage has rested, transfer it to a work surface [16] and use a rolling pin and a little flour [17] to roll it out slightly [18] to obtain an 8-inch (20x20 cm) square. At this point, set it aside for a moment, transferring it to a lightly floured area of the work surface. 
Using a dough cutter, move the détrempe to a lightly floured [19] work surface and, again using the rolling pin, roll it out [20] to a larger square of around 11x11 inches (28x28 cm) [21].
Next, place the beurrage on the diamond-shaped détrempe and enclose it by pulling the corners of the diamond up [22] and in toward the center [23]. Make sure the closed corners don’t overlap one another too much, so that you perfectly enclose the beurrage [24], forming what is known as the paton. At this point, make the first fold without letting it rest first.
