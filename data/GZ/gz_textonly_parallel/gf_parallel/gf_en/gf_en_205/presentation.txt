There are countless ways to use it, and it’s a perennial staple in pastry shops. Along with pie dough and choux pastry, in fact, puff pastry is one of the ultimate basic recipes. Now used all over the world, the French have been going crazy for it since the 1700s. Also known as pâte feuilletée, because it is as light as a puff of air, puff pastry is a very versatile dough with a neutral flavor, making it a great base for both sweet and savory recipes!  Making puff pastry takes a touch of patience and just a pinch of experience since you have to handle the ingredients gently so that the air can get between the various layers of dough and butter, and then expand during cooking through a process known as “physical leavening.” To discover all of the secrets of this dough, we invited young chef Franco Aliberti, who so passionately shared with us all of his tricks for getting the perfect result with 432 fragrant layers, to come to our kitchen and enlighten us! So, what are you waiting for? Grab your rolling pin, because here we go! Oh, and once you’ve learned this technique, why not try your hand at making our Italian-style croissants!
