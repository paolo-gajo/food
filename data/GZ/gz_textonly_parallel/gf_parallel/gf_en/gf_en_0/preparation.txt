To prepare the zuppa inglese (Italian trifle), start by making the pan di Spagna (sponge cake). Pour the eggs into a bowl at room temperature and beat them with a whisk while adding the sugar a little at a time [1]. Continue for about ten minutes or until the mixture becomes clear and frothy: you can also do the "writing" test by lifting a spoonful of the mixture and letting it drip as if you were tracing letters with it [2]. Next, place a strainer in the bowl and pour in the flour and potato starch [3].
Fold in the dry ingredients with gentle upward movements, making sure that no residue is left on the bottom of the bowl [4]. Pour the dough into a previously buttered and floured 7-inch (18 cm) round mold  [5]. Level the surface with a rubber spatula and bake in a preheated oven, in static mode at 320°F (160°C) for about 40 minutes, placing the drip pan on the lower shelf (not in contact with the base); leave to cool and then remove from the pan [6].
