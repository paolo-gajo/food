The art of pastry making is based on three characteristics. The first is perfection: pastry making is pure chemistry. An example? The magic cake, a cake that consists of 3 different layers whose magic would not exist without carefully obtained balances. The second characteristic is making mistakes: particularly important desserts, such as torta caprese (chocolate cake) or French ganache, are the result of forgetting to add an ingredient. Finally, pastry making is also the mixture and transformation of great classics such as Saint Honor√© or trifle, an English dessert that probably inspired this recipe: zuppa inglese (Italian trifle). Zuppa inglese (Italian trifle) is a very famous dessert, classified among the typical pastry specialties of Emilia Romagna and has become an Italian classic with regional variations. Preparing zuppa inglese is not difficult at all; by making the two bases ahead of time, it will be amazingly easy to assemble and serve as a dessert on a special day! It is difficult to resist this creamy dessert made of layers of sponge cake soaked in alchermes, with a sweet and light chocolate custard cream alternating with vanilla-flavored cream!
