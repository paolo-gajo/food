To prepare the pear and chocolate cake, start by peeling the coscia pears [1]: cut them into quarters and remove the core [2]. Place the slices in a non-stick pan, douse with Moscato wine [3] and cook on the stove over high heat.
Let it cook for about ten minutes, the time to make the wine reduce; once done, let it cool down [4]. In the meantime, chop the dark chocolate [5] and melt it in a bain-marie (alternatively you can melt it in the microwave) [6] stirring with a spatula.
Once melted, turn it off and add the butter at room temperature [7], stir continuously to melt it; then set aside [8]. Take the eggs that must be at room temperature, separate the egg whites from the yolks and divide them into two separate bowls [9].
Use an electric mixer (make sure the beaters are clean) to beat the egg whites [10] to stiff peaks [11]. Pour the sugar with the yolks [12] and with the same beater whip the mixture a few moments until it is clear, but not frothy.
Pour the melted chocolate in a beaded thread into the whipped egg yolks with the sugar and with the beaters running at low speed [13]. Now roughly crumble the macaroons with your hands [14] and add them to the egg yolk and chocolate mixture [15].
In a separate bowl sift the flour and baking powder [16]; add these powders to the mixture also [17] mixing with a spatula, until a uniform and very compact mixture is obtained. To finish, incorporate half of the egg whites into the mixture [18] and stir vigorously to soften; then add the remaining half of the egg whites folding in gently from the bottom to the top.
The dough is ready [19]: butter and flour a 9 1/2" (24 cm) round cake pan, pour some batter into the pan, about half of it, to cover the bottom and level with a spatula [20]. Distribute the slices of pears that are now warm (the slices will be soft and will have absorbed the wine, otherwise drain them well before laying them on the base); arrange the pear quarters in a radial pattern, taking care to leave a free space of 1/4" (half a centimeter) from the edge [21].
Cover with the remaining part of the dough and level the surface again with the spatula [22]; then, in order to distribute the mixture evenly, roll the baking tray on the surface, without beating it to avoid inhibiting the leavening agent. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 45 minutes. Test with a toothpick before taking the cake out: if it is slightly creamy inside, take it out gently and let it cool completely at room temperature to prevent it from drying out too much [23]. The pear and chocolate cake is ready to be enjoyed [24]!
