To prepare Oreo® cake start from the base: divide the 16 Oreo® cookies and remove the cream using a spatula [1]. Place it in a bowl and leave to one side [2]. Now place the biscuit part in the bowl of a bladed mixer [3]
along with the chopped butter at room temperature [4]. Blend to obtain a crumbly and thoroughly amalgamated mixture [5]. Place on a 7 inch (18 cm) pastry dish on a tray lined with parchment paper and add the biscuits blended with the butter. Press the mixture down with the back of a spoon [6]
to cover the entire base [7]. Place back in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Prepare the filling in the meantime: beat the cream and powdered sugar using an electric whisk [8], until firm [9]. 
Place the Oreo® cream set aside for later in a bowl [10], together with the spreadable cheese [11]. Stir with the electric whisk for around 1 minute.
Upon obtaining a smooth cream, incorporate the previously whipped cream, stirring from the bottom up (13-14). Now remove the base from the refrigerator and pour the cream over it [15].
Smooth the surface with the back of a spoon [16]. Blend 8 whole Oreo® cookies in the mixer, without removing the cream from the inside (17-18).
Place the blended cookies on the cake [19] and spread over the entire surface, without pressing down too much (20-21). Place back in the refrigerator for at least 1 and a half hours.
Take the cake [22] and run the blade of a knife along the outer edge [23] so that you can remove the ring more easily [24].
After removing from the mold [25], beat the cream with an electric whisk [26] and put it in a 0.4 inch (1 cm) star-tipped pastry bag [27].
Now add tufts of cream to the surface of the cake [28] and garnish with Oreo® cookies split in half [29]. Serve your Oreo® cake nice and cold [30].
