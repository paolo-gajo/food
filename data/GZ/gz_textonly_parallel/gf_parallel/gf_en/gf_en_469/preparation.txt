To prepare coconut bites, start by sieving the ricotta cheese in a bowl, which will make it creamier [1]; add the powdered sugar [2] and stir with a spatula [3].
Once you obtain an even mixture, add 5 tablespoons of shredded coconut [4] and stir once more until fully incorporated [5]. Now take around 0.7 oz of the mixture with a spoon [6],
place it on the palm of your hand [7] and roll it [8] into a ball [9].
Place it in a bowl where you will have added the shredded coconut for final garnishing [10] and move it delicately to cover the entire surface. As you make the coconut bites, place each one on a tray [11]; with these amounts you should make 35 balls, each around 0.7 oz. Now place them in the refrigerator for around 10 minutes so that they firm up a little and above all, so that they are cool when served. Your coconut bites are ready: all you have to do now is serve them [12]!
