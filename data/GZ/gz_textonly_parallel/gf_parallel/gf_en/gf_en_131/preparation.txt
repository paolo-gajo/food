The first step when making a soft lemon cake is to squeeze a lemon: You’ll need ½ cup (100 g) of juice [1]. Then beat the eggs and sugar [2] using an electric beater. When the mixture is frothy, add a pinch of salt and pour in the oil slowly [3].
Then add the zest of 2 lemons [4] and the squeezed juice [5]. Beat again to blend all the ingredients. Sift the flour and baking powder [6] into another bowl 
and fold the dry ingredients into the mixture a tablespoonful at a time [7]. Mix again to incorporate the dry ingredients evenly [8]. Now butter a 9-inch (22 cm) diameter mold and pour in the mixture [9]. Bake in a preheated conventional oven for 50 minutes at 340°F (170°).
Do the toothpick test before taking the cake out of the oven, then let it cool and gently turn it out of the mold. Allow it to cool completely on a wire rack [10], then dust the surface with powdered sugar [11] before serving your soft lemon cake [12]!
