A delicious sweet brioche with a snowy filling has been all the rage in Naples for a few years now. The name of this recipe, created by Pasticceria Poppella, was chosen to describe its spotless appearance: Meet the snowflake! These cute little domes covered in powdered sugar harbor a light and fluffy ricotta filling with a delicate suggestion of vanilla. The original recipe is jealously guarded by its creators, just like the polacca aversana, a delicacy from the town of Aversa in Campania with close links to another famous pastry shop. We wanted to show you our own version of this sweet, and we’re sure you won’t be disappointed! Don't rush the dough during the leavening process but use the resting time to make the fillings for the snowflakes. Your dedication will be rewarded by these delectable balls of sweetness that are ideal to savor at any time of day.
