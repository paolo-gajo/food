Today we are preparing a dish that’s just bursting with flavor and color, a combination of completely different tastes and fragrances coming together to create a truly special balance that only bow tie pasta with arugula & lemon pesto and cherry tomatoes can provide. It starts out with the slightly bitter taste of the arugula, but before you know it, the freshness of the lemon will come through to awaken your taste buds ready for the next, altogether sweeter encounter in the form of the cherry tomatoes. Great for a dinner with friends or for lunch in the office, and a perfect dish to serve hot, but even better served cold. The ideal treat on a hot day!
