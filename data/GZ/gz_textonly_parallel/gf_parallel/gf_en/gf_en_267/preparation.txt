To make your pasta with arugula & lemon pesto and cherry tomatoes, start with the tomatoes. Wash them, cut them in half [1], and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [2] with the cut side facing upwards. Season with salt and sprinkle with the sugar [3].
Next, drizzle them with extra virgin olive oil [4] and bake in a convection oven preheated to 250°F (120°C) for around 2 hours. Once the tomatoes are cooked and shriveled, remove them from the oven [5]. Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste [6]. Drain the pasta, transfer to a bowl, drizzle with a little oil and leave to cool. 
Place the flaked almonds on a baking pan [7] and toast them in a conventional oven at 390°F (200°C) for a few minutes until golden brown [8]. Meanwhile, start preparing the pesto. Place the arugula in a food processor and add the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [9].
Next, add the pine nuts [10], a pinch of salt, and the lemon juice [11], and pulse to blend everything together gradually, adding the oil a little at a time [12]. 
This will create your pesto [13] for dressing the bow tie pasta [14]. Plate up and garnish each dish with the confit cherry tomatoes [15], 
flaked almonds [16], and some lemon peel [17]. Your pasta with arugula & lemon pesto and cherry tomatoes is ready to enjoy [18].
