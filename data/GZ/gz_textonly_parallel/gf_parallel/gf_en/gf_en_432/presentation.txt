Did you know that the number 1 dish of Italian restaurants in the United States is a recipe that is entirely unfamiliar to us? We're talking about fettuccine Alfredo, so popular in America that it almost seem to be a dish of Italo-American tradition! And yet nothing could be more Italian than fettuccine Alfredo, a simple and delicious egg pastaÂ served with lashings of butter and parmesan cheese. The recipe was invented in 1914 by Alfredo, the owner of a restaurant in via della Scrofa, Rome, with the aim of getting his wife's strength up after she had been weakened by pregnancy and giving birth. She liked the dish so much that she suggested her husband should add it to the menu and from that day on it became the restaurant's flagship dish! However, the real consecration of fettuccine Alfredo came when Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, two famous Hollywood actors, tried the pasta dish on their honeymoon in Rome and were so impressed that as a token of gratitude they gave Alfredo two golden pieces of cutlery: a spoon and a fork, inscribed with a dedication: "To Alfredo the King of Noodles". From that day on, Alfredo's restaurant became a favorite destination of American stars in the roaring Twenties, as well as the population of Rome's Dolce Vita, contributing to the success of the dish across the ocean! So what are you waiting for? Get kneading that dough and prepare some fettuccine Alfredo for your friends, we're certain you too will earn the title of "king of fettuccine"!
