To prepare the pizza dough, we chose to knead by hand, but if you prefer to use a mixer, follow the same steps, using the hook spatula at a medium-low speed. Start by placing both flours in a bowl [1], add the crumbled yeast [2] and a small part of the water [3]. The ideal temperature of the water is 77°F (25°C).
Stir with a wooden spoon [4] and gradually add the water [5]. Continue stirring all the while, and after you have poured in around half of the water, you can add the salt too [6].
Gradually add the remaining water to obtain a homogeneous mixture; you will find it is easier to knead by hand [7]. Lastly, place the dough on a worktop and knead by hand [8] until smooth and homogeneous [9].
Once you have made a nice, smooth piece of dough, leave it to rest on the worktop for ten minutes or so, covered with the bowl [10]. Once rested, give it a little fold: imagine the ball is divided into 4 parts, so hold each one by the tip, pull delicately and fold inwards [11]. Fold the dough [12].
Turn it around [13] and shape it into a ball [14]. Place the dough ball in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap [15] and leave to leaven. You may find it best to place the bowl in a switched off oven with the lights on, so that the temperature reaches 78-82°F (25-30°C), ideal for leavening, or you could leave the bowl somewhere warm. The length of time is approximate as the temperature and weather influence leavening and each dough is slightly different. On average, it should take 6 hours for the dough to double in volume.
Once the leavening time is up, the dough will be nice and plump [16]; place it on the worktop and divide it into three pieces with a spatula, 9 oz (250 g) each. You may need to sprinkle a little flour onto the worktop. Now take each portion and as before, lift the dough up by the edge [18] and fold inwards.
Repeat for the other 3 edges of dough [19]. Now stretch out the dough by folding it in on itself, then proceed to round the dough by turning it around by hand on the worktop, folding it away from you and then towards you repeatedly, until you make a smooth and regular ball [21].
Place each piece of dough in a previously greased pizza tray [22], cover with the lid [23] and leave to rest for another 30 minutes [24] before stretching the pizza dough out and topping it to taste!
