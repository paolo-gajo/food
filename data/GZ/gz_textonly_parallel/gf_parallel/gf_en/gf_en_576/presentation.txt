We've often repeated that simple recipes are the best and in this case we won't deny it: avocado chocolate mousse is a creamy summer dessert made with only three ingredients that can be prepared in less than half an hour! If you liked the avocado and chocolate popsicles, then you'll love the same flavor combination in this sweetly velvety version, which will allow you to fully appreciate the buttery texture of the avocado and its slight nutty aroma, the perfect complement to the intensity of dark chocolate. Naturally vegan and gluten-free, avocado chocolate mousse is the ideal choice if you're looking for a last-minute dessert for a dinner with friends, but also for a nutritious snack to tempt even the most indulgent kids!Â All that's left is for you to try it out!
