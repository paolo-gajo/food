To prepare the chocolate and avocado mousse, first cut the avocado in half [1] and remove the pit using a spoon [2], then extract the pulp (you will get about 8.5 oz) and put it in a blender [3].
Add the sugar [4] and blend until you get a smooth and lump-free cream [5]. Melt the chocolate in the microwave at 900W for about 2 minutes, stirring it every 30 seconds [6] to prevent it from burning; alternatively, you can melt it using a double boiler or the bain marie method.
Combine the avocado cream with melted chocolate [7] and mix well with a spatula to blend everything [8], then transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped tip [9] and let it firm up in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.
After the resting time, fill 4 glasses with the chocolate and avocado mixture, then garnish with pistachio [10] and sliced almonds [11]: your avocado chocolate mousse is ready to be served [12]!
