Star cookiesÂ were created from a simple and genuine recipe for a delicious shortcrust pastry, which is perfect for making with little ones during the festive season. Fragrant and crumbly, these biscuits can be hung from the Christmas tree with colorful ribbons, but they also make delicious seat markers or appetizing gifts, accompanied with some aromatic homemade liqueur, like the coffee one. Be sure to have cookie cutters and aprons ready - bring all the magic of Christmas to the table has never been so easy!
