To make star cookies, place the flour [1], yeast and cold diced butter [2] in a capacious bowl. Add the egg [3]
and sugar [4]. Flavor with the seeds of a vanilla bean [5] and the orange or lemon peel [6].
Mix the ingredients together by hand [7]. Now that you have gathered all the ingredients together [8], move to a pastry board and shape the piece of dough so that it is smooth and homogeneous [9].
Roll the shortcrust pastry out with a rolling pin [10]. It should be 0.1-0.2 inches thick [11]. Now use the star-shaped cookie cutter to shape the dough [12].
Use the special cylinder [13] to make a hole in the middle of each star [14]. You can also make holes with smaller star cookie cutter [15].
Place the stars on an oven tray lined with parchment paper, brush some egg white onto the surface and sprinkle with brown sugar [16]. Any leftover pastry scraps can be rolled out once more to create other stars [17]. Bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for around 20 minutes. Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven [18] and leave them to cool before enjoying them or hanging them on your tree!
