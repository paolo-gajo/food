It is prepared at Easter to celebrate spring and the reawakening of nature and is great served as an outdoor snack. You will have already heard of savory Easter pie, made of delicious pastry layers and a delicious filling, a typical specialty of Ligurian culinary tradition, an unmissable Easter menu. It is usually filled with spinach or herbs, ricotta cheese and eggs of course, which you will discover as soon as you cut the first slice. All this is enveloped in thin pastry sheets, making it the perfect savory pie for enjoying on Easter bank holiday, along with the less well-known Ligurian chard cake. Its origins date back to ancient times: in 1400 it was already known as a dish linked to the symbolism of Easter, not only because it contains eggs, but due it its characteristic thin shell, which legend has it, was made up of no less than 33 pastry sheets, one for each year of the life of Jesus. For it to be within everyone's reach, here we offer an equally delicious version, made with just 4 pastry layers. Layer after layer, savory Easter pie will win you over with its timeless rustic flavors: are you ready to share it with friends and family?
