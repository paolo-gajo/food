Dumplings, like meatballs, are always sure to be a big hit, and can be cooked in a thousand different ways that vary from one region to another and depending on individual tastes. Come with us, if you will, on a journey to the Trentino-Alto Adige region, where they’ve been making Knödel, or canederli, for centuries! These hearty bread dumplings are made with stale white bread, chives, eggs, speck, and onion (Tyrolean-style), and with the addition of smoked lucanica sausage if you make them Trentino-style. Every family has its own secret way of preparing these dumplings with just the right consistency, not too hard or too soft, but one thing everyone agrees on is that meat broth is the tastiest and most authentic way to cook and enjoy them. If you’d rather serve them with butter instead, you can boil them in boiling salted water before dressing them. We’ve gone with a recipe for Tyrolean-style dumplings that was registered on August 8, 2003, but we’ve also picked up some tips from people who’ve been making them at home for decades using a recipe handed down through the family, who maintain that these dumplings must be “dirty,” with clearly visible pieces of meat and chives. We’ve chosen a pretty rustic version, with a dough that compacts and combines without losing the flavor or appearance of the bread. You’ll find many different types of dumplings served in restaurants, delis, and at fairs these days, some with spinach, some with herbs, others with beets, but the best introduction to Italian dumplings are undoubtedly the classic Tyrolean Knödel! So, ready to be whisked away to the Alps?
