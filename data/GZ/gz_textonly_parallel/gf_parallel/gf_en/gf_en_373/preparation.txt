To make your Knödel, first prepare the meat broth and keep it warm. Next, peel and finely chop the onion [1]. Cut the speck into very small pieces [2] of around 110 inch (2-3 mm) [3].
Melt the butter in a pan over low heat [4], then add the onion [5] and speck [6]. Brown for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Then turn off the heat and set aside [7]. Chop the chives and parsley [8], then cut the stale bread into cubes of around ¼ inch (0.5 cm) [9].
Pour the bread into a bowl and add the milk (start with ¾ cup (200 g) and add more if the mixture is too dry and not very malleable) [10]. Add the eggs [11] and the chopped chives and parsley [12].
Continue adding the warm speck and onion [13], and start mixing everything together [14]. If the mixture is too dry, add more milk. If it’s gone too sticky or soft, try adding a little flour to the mixture. Once the mixture is ready, moisten your hands a little with cold water and shape the dumplings by rolling the dough between your hands. The dumplings should be around 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter [15].
Place them on a tray as you shape them [16]. You should end up with around 10 of them. Once they’re ready, you’ll need to cook your dumplings in the boiling meat stock [17], which should take around 15 minutes at a moderate simmer. Serve your Knödel (Tyrolean-style dumplings) piping hot [18].
