To prepare the eggless strawberry tiramisu, start by washing the strawberries under running water. Then take about 3/4 cups of them (making sure to set aside 6 whole strawberries for garnishing and layering). Remove the stems and leaves [1], cut them into small pieces [2]. Transfer the strawberry pieces to a blender, add 3 tbsp of lemon juice [3].
Add 1 cup of powdered sugar [4] and blend everything until you obtain a creamy and homogeneous puree [5], which you will then use to soak the ladyfingers. Now move on to the cream: pour the fresh cream into a bowl and beat it with electric beaters [6]
When it starts to thicken, gradually add 50g of powdered sugar [7]. Once finished, soften the mascarpone cheese with a spoon, then add it to the whipped cream, stirring very gently from the bottom to the top to avoid deflating the cream [8]. For optimal results, it is recommended to first mix a tablespoon of mascarpone cheese into the whipped cream to obtain a smoother mixture, and then gradually add the remaining mascarpone cheese and mix gently. Flavor it with grated lemon zest [9].
Transfer the cream obtained into a pastry bag with a smooth nozzle [10], take 4 glass cups with a capacity of 180g, pour a first layer of mascarpone cream on the bottom [11]. Then take the ladyfingers, cut them to fit the size of the cup, then dip the ladyfingers into the previously prepared strawberry syrup [12]
and place them in glass cups [13]. Now chop 2 of the strawberries that were set aside into small pieces and distribute them on top of the ladyfingers [14]. Finish off the cups with a layer of mascarpone cream [15].
To garnish, take the remaining 4 strawberries, make cuts lengthwise on each strawberry without removing the stem [16] to create a fan-like effect to open in each glass cup. Place each open strawberry to decorate the glass cups [17]. Your delicious eggless strawberry tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed [18]!
