To prepare cherry crumble, start with the filling. Rinse the cherries under running water, dry them with a cloth and pit them using a pitter [1]. Place them in a bowl, add the sugar [2] and the grated peel of a lemon [3]. Be sure to use the yellow part of the skin only, without grating the more bitter tasting white part.
Amalgamate with a spatula to even out the ingredients [4] and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature [5]; turn over occasionally with a spoon. In the meantime, prepare the dough for the crumble. Cut the vanilla bean open lengthwise and remove the seeds using a smooth bladed knife [6]. Leave the vanilla seeds to one side for later.
Now place the flour [7], the brown sugar [8] and the cinnamon powder [9] in a large bowl, 
along with the vanilla seeds [10]; lastly, add the softened butter at room temperature [11]. Start kneading the ingredients together rapidly with your finger tips, to obtain a granular and crumbly consistency [12]; try to make sure the butter comes into contact with the dry ingredients.
The result should be a dough that is crumbly but not sandy in consistency (true to the name of this dessert). Leave the crumble to one side [13]. Take 4 molds, 3.2 inches in diameter and 2 inches tall, and fill each one with a few spoons of cherries [14] and smooth the fruit base out [15].
Cover each mold with the previously prepared crumble mixture right to the top [16], Arrange the molds on a baking tray and bake in a static oven preheated to 356?F for 30 minutes [17]. The surface of the crumble should turn golden and crumbly when ready. Remove from the oven while still hot [18]. Serve you cherry crumble hot, straight from the mold.
