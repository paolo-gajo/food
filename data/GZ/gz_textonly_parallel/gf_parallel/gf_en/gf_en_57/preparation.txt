To make tomino burger, start by preparing the marinade for the tomino cheese: place the peperoncino flavored oil [1], the thyme [2] and the crushed garlic [3] in a bowl (alternatively you can add the peeled garlic clove whole and remove after marinating).
Evenly grease the tomino cheese on all sides [4], then place them in a bowl and cover with the marinade [5], seal the lid [6] and leave to marinade at room temperature for 1 hour (ideally leave over night in the refrigerator and remove 1 hour before cooking).
 Clean the pumpkin and cut into slices that are around 0.2 inches thick (7-8): the amount of cleaned pumpkin you want is 5.3 oz. When done marinating, remove the tomino cheese from the tin and place the pumpkin slices inside to flavor them in the same marinade,
and add a pinch of salt [10]. In the meantime preheat the static oven to 390°F (200°C). When nicely seasoned, place the pumpkin on an oven tray [11] and bake in a static oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for around 20 minutes or until tender. Wash the turnip greens, cut away the tougher part of the stalks and then separate the stalks from the leaves [12]. 
Finely chop the stalks [13] and place them in the mixer bowl, with around three quarters of a tablespoons of oil [14], the salt, the pine nuts [15] 
and the grated parmigiano cheese [16]. Blend everything into a homogeneous pesto [17]. Now cook the leaves: heat a drizzle of oil in a pan with an unpeeled crushed garlic clove [18];
Once the oil is flavored remove the garlic [19] and add the turnip greens, salt [20], then sauté on a high flame for around 5 minutes and leave to one side [21].
Cut the burger rolls in half [22], place them on a tray, with the sliced part facing upwards [23], and heat in the oven 2 minutes before the pumpkin cooking time is up. The rolls and the pumpkin are ready [24]; now you can prepare the tomino cheese:
cook the tomino cheese in a hot non-stick pan for 2 minutes on each side on a low flame; make sure they don't break up [25]. Spread the pesto you made with the turnip green stalks on the bottom half of the rolls [26], add the pumpkin slices [27],
then the tomino cheese [28] and complete with the sautéed turnip greens [29]; lastly, close with the upper part of the roll [30]. Your tomino burgers are ready to be enjoyed!
