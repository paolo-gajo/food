Excellent when served as finger food at a buffet or with drinks, fried paccheri will undoubtedly impress your guests. Simple to prepare, they draw inspiration from a Neapolitan recipe. In Naples, where they're known as schiaffoni, they are typically filled and fried, becoming a treat for the palate. Due to their large size and robust consistency, paccheri is the ideal pasta shape for a rich filling, which can be meat-based, as seen in recipes like paccheri filled with sausage and mushrooms, fish-based, or vegetarian, as showcased in this recipe. The creaminess of ricotta cheese pairs wonderfully with the distinct flavor of pecorino cheese, and savor the cascade of melted mozzarella. For that perfect crispy finish, we've chosen a double egg and breadcrumb coating. Are your friends on their way? For a unique touch, serve your fried paccheri in glasses, with a touch of tomato sauce at the bottom and garnish with a basil leaf. Be sure to make plenty of fried paccheri; they're so morish that they'll vanish in no time!
