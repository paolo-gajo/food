To prepare fried paccheri start by making the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and sauté in a drizzle of oil on a medium flame [1], add the tomato puree [2] and water [3], stir and leave to cook on a low flame for around 20 minutes.
Prepare the filling in the meantime. Finely chop the mozzarella [4] and place it in a bowl, together with the ricotta cheese [5]. Now add the salt, pepper and grated pecorino cheese [6].
Roughly chop the basil and add to the ricotta cheese mixture [7], then add the milk [8] and stir thoroughly with a spoon to mix all the ingredients together [9].
Cook the paccheri in abundant boiling water salted to taste [10] and drain them 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time [11]. Drain, place them on a clean cloth and leave to dry [12].
In the meantime place the ricotta cheese mix in a pastry bag and use it to fill your paccheri [13]. Once you have filled all the paccheri [14], prepare the breadcrumb coating. Beat the eggs in a bowl [15].
Add the salt, the milk, and beat some more [16]. Now dip each pacchero in the egg [17] and then in the breadcrumbs [18].
Repeat to create a double coating, by dipping each pacchero in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs once more [19]. Continue until all the paccheri are coated, then place them on a tray [20]. Heat the seed oil and check to make sure it reaches 338°F, using a kitchen thermometer. Once at the right temperature, add a couple of paccheri at a time [21].
Fry for a couple of minutes until nice and golden [22]. Drain the excess oil and place them on some absorbent paper [23]. Serve your fried paccheri nice and hot. Place them in a glass with a little tomato sauce on the bottom and garnish with a basil leaf.
