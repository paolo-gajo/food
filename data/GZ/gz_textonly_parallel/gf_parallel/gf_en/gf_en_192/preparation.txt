To prepare the Bolognese sauce, first take the pancetta. First cut into slices and then into strips [1], without being too precise. Then with a knife chop it well [2]. In a pre-heated saucepan pour a drizzle of oil and add the pancetta [3].
Shell it well [4] and let it brown. In the meantime, take care of the vegetables. Peel the carrot and chop it finely [5]. Then clean the celery and chop it too of the same size as your carrots [6].
Finally, peel the onion and chop it [7]. As soon as the pancetta is well browned [8], add the chopped vegetables [9].
Stir [10] and let simmer for 5-6 minutes [11]. Add the ground beef [12],
stir [13] and raise the heat. Let it brown without haste, the meat must seal well. Deglaze with red wine [14] and mix again. As soon as the alcohol has evaporated, add the tomato puree [15].
Stir and incorporate it [16] [17]. Add a couple of ladles of hot vegetable broth [18].
Cover with the lid, but do not close completely [19]. At this point the Bolognese sauce must cook for at least 2 hours. Check it every 20 minutes and add more broth as needed. After two hours, taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper [20]. Stir again and your sauce will be ready [21].
