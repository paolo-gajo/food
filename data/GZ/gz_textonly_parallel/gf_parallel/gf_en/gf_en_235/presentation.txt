After making sweet croissants for breakfast and savory croissants as an appetizer with drinks, pizza croissants were bound to be next on our list! Yes that's right: instead of puff pastry we've used pizza dough to create a sort of typical crescent-shaped panzerotti. However, instead of baking in the oven, we present you with this irresistible fried version that will make everyone's mouth water! A tomato and mozzarella filling has been chosen for this recipe, just like the most classic of pizza toppings, but feel free to enrich it however you like, by creating even more tantalizing and inviting flavors. Pizza croissants are ideal enjoyed with your friends, served with fresh beer, but they are just one of many reinterpretations of this well-loved recipe: try pizza rings or muffins!
