To make pizza croissants, start by preparing the dough: place the dough in a large bowl [1], add the crumbled yeast [2] and all the water [3]. Mix by hand and then stir the yeast in thoroughly with a ladle.
Add the salt [4] and oil [5], then start kneading [6].
Place the dough on a work top and continue to knead for around 10 minutes [7], until smooth and homogeneous. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave to leaven for around 3 hours and 30 minutes, until it doubles in volume [8]. In the meantime you can cut the mozzarella into strips [9].
Once the leavening time is up [10], place the dough on a work top lightly sprinkled with dough and press down gently with your hands [11], before rolling it out using a rolling pin, into a 0.4 inch thick rectangle [12].
Fold one of the short sides to the middle [13], then repeat on the other side: make sure the edges match [14], then fold the rectangle in half [15]: in this way you will form a 4-way-fold.
Spread the dough out once more to form a rectangle, this time 0.8 inches thick [16]. Divide the rectangle in half lengthwise [17] and use each half to form 8 triangles, so that there are 16 in total [18].
Spread and gently pull out each triangle [19], then spread the tomato puree previously flavored with salt and oil over the surface [20]. Add a few strips of mozzarella [21].
Roll the triangles up from the base [22] to the tip [23], then place them on a tray lined with parchment paper, with the closed side down [24]. Cover with plastic wrap or with another tray and leave to leaven for another hour.
Once this time is up, heat the seed oil to 320?. In the meantime cut the parchment paper around each croissant [25], so that it will be easier to slide them into the hot oil [26]. Fry 1-2 croissants a time, for around 3 minutes, then place them on the absorbent paper [27]. Your pizza croissants are ready to be enjoyed!
