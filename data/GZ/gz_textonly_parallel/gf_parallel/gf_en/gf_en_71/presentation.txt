Fancy some homemade pizza? Today we'll prepare a magnificently tall and soft tray-baked pizza! To make it we'll use a blend of flours, for a moist and perfectly firm dough that will be just right. We've chosen the most classic of all toppings, mozzarella cheese and tomato, just like in cheese and tomato pizza, which is always popular with everyone! Obviously no one is stopping you from trying out new flavors and enriching this base however you like. The thing you'll need to pay the most attention to with this dough is the folding and resting times. This is the only way to make a moist dough and achieve an extremely soft result! So get ready to make some seriously tall and soft tray-baked pizza for the entire family!?
