Before preparing the speck, radicchio, and caciocavallo risotto, place a pot full of lightly salted water over heat for the vegetable broth. Cut the speck first into slices and then very thin strips [1], and then the caciocavallo into strips [2] and small cubes [3].
Cut the radicchio in half [4] and, using a knife, remove the toughest part [5], then cut it into fairly thin strips [6].
Melt the butter in a pot, then brown the speck strips over low heat for around 5 minutes [7]; once the speck has turned golden and crispy, turn off the heat, remove the speck using a skimmer and put it in a separate bowl [8]. Place a large nonstick pan over heat and add a splash of oil [9] 
and the garlic clove [10]; let it brown and then remove from the heat. Cook the radicchio slices for 3 minutes over high heat [11], stirring every once in a while, and then turn off the heat and set aside [12].
Toast the rice in a pan with a drizzle of oil [13], stirring every once in a while, then add the white wine [14] and allow to evaporate. Cook the rice for 18 minutes, adding a ladleful of vegetable broth [15] every now and then.
Once the rice is al dente, add the radicchio [16] and speck [17]. After a few minutes, remove the pan from the heat and add the caciocavallo cubes [18]; stir to get them to melt in.
Season with thyme leaves [19] and salt and pepper to taste [20]. Your speck, radicchio, and caciocavallo risotto is ready to be served piping hot [21].
