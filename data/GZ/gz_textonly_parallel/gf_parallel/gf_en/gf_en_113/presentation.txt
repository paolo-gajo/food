Speck, radicchio, and caciocavallo risotto is a rich and fragrant first course dish that includes a pleasant pairing of flavors that are a firm favorite in the kitchen, namely the combination of speck and radicchio. This is a great risotto that’s perfect for a variety of occasions: The golden, crispy speck goes so well with the caciocavallo, a sweet, delicately flavored cheese that becomes even more pungent and flavorful as it matures, along with the pan-fried radicchio cut into thin strips. The result? A rustic dish with a strong yet balance flavor that’s absolutely worth trying on a cold winter’s day!
