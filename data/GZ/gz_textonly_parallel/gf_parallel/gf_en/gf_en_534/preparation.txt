To make the brioches, start with the dough. Add the flour and sugar [1] to the bowl of a planetary mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Next, add the yeast (crumbled) [2], the seeds from one vanilla bean [3], 
and the zest of one lemon [4]. Turn the planetary mixer on medium speed and pour the water in slowly [5]. Once the water has been fully absorbed, add the salt [6]
and then the egg yolks one at a time, waiting for each one to be absorbed before adding another [7]. Continue working the dough until it clings to the hook [8]. At this point, you’ll be able to add the butter, which should be soft but still pliable, adding it one pat at a time [9]. Wait for each pat to be well absorbed before adding another. Don’t rush, or else it will be difficult to get the dough to cling to the hook again. During this step, you can stop the mixer several times and use a scraper to remove any dough that’s sticking to the sides of the mixer bowl.
Once the dough is clinging to the hook again [10], having pulled away from the sides of the bowl, transfer it to a level work surface [11]. If the dough is very sticky, you can work it a little using the slap and fold technique, without beating it. To do this, just lift the dough gently, stretch it and fold it back on itself [12]. If it’s still too sticky, wait a couple of minutes and then repeat the slap and fold process.
Next, round the dough, using a scraper to help remove it from the work surface, shaping it into a ball [13]. Transfer to a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap [14] and leave to rise for an hour and a half at a temperature of between 78°F and 82°F (26°C to 28°C). An ideal place would be in the oven with the oven off but the light turned on and a saucepan of hot water placed on the bottom of the oven. If this isn’t possible and you leave the dough at room temperature, protected from air currents, at a temperature lower than indicated, it may need more time to rise. Once the dough has doubled in size [15],
turn it out onto the work surface [16] and divide it into 18 1.75-oz (50 g) pieces [17]. Take the first portion and give strength to the dough by making folds quickly, then lift an outer edge of the dough and bring it toward the center. Repeat this process several times. Round the dough pieces, quickly shaping them into little balls [18].
Arrange them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [19]. Leave to rise again for one hour. Beat the egg yolk with a little cream and use it to brush the surface [20]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven [21] and serve once cooled.
