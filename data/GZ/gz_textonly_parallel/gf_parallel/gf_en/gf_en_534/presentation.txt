Breakfast means brioche! It’s not just an Italian custom; brioches are widespread and famous all over Europe. These soft, fluffy pastries consist of leavened dough made from egg yolks and butter and take many different shapes: classic round brioches such as mini buns, brioche à tête that have a round ball on top forming the “tête” or “head”, or braided brioches. We’ll show you how to make all three, so your breakfast is delicious every time, no matter what shape it comes in! Once the brioches are ready, you can eat them plain, sprinkled with powdered sugar, or filled with the classic pastry cream, Nutella, or jelly.  With this recipe, you’ll be able to make brioches so good, the bakery will have nothing on you. If you’d like to increase the level of difficulty, you can even try two-tone croissants, Italian-style croissants, or, if you’re someone who prefers a savory breakfast, don’t miss the recipe for our plain croissants.
