There are genuine and hearty dishes that will warm your belly and heart, especially at high altitude! If you are in Valtellina, in particular in the small town of Teglio, you cannot but taste the pizzoccheri. Beware of imitations, however: although it is a dish of humble origins, pizzoccheri pasta is a dish whose goodness comes not only from the processing of ingredients, but also from their selection: stone-ground buckwheat flour, cabbage from the garden, alpine butter are some of the must-haves to leave your guests really amazed. At Giallozafferano we too relied on a chef from Valtellina, Alessandro Negrini, an expert in this rustic dish from an early age, when his grandmother made it. Following in the footsteps of tradition, you can make this rich and enjoyable dish, in the summer or winter, by starting with the pizzoccheri, a pasta shape similar to tagliatelle but shorter, made of buckwheat flour, type 0 flour and water. To discover all the authentic taste of this first course, follow the steps and suggestions for cooking and sharing a fabulous hot and stringy pizzoccheri pasta dish!
