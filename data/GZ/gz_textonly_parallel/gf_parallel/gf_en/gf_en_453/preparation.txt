To make cream and strawberries dessert, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry for the crumble: place the flour, powdered sugar [1] and cold diced butter in the mixer [2]. Blend at a medium speed until sandy in consistency. Now add the eggs [3] and continue to blend at a medium speed.
When ready, place the resulting dough on a worktop sprinkled with flour [4], shape into a ball and cover with plastic wrap [5]; leave it to rest in the refrigerator for at least half an hour. Once the resting time is up, preheat the static oven to 356°F (180°C), line a baking tray with parchment paper and grate the previously prepared shortcrust dough using a thick grater [6], or blend in the mixer.
Spread the grated shortcrust dough over the baking tray [7] and bake for 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes are up, remove the tray from the oven, delicately crumble the shortcrust pastry by hand [8] and bake for another 10 minutes so that the crumble turns nice and golden. Once baked leave it to cool [9], then crumble some more by hand.
Now wash, dry and cut the strawberries into pieces [10]; place the thoroughly chilled cream in a bowl, straight from the refrigerator [11], and beat with an electric whisk, gradually adding the powdered sugar [12].
Once firm, add the strawberry pieces and stir them in [13]. Now you're ready to compose the dessert: line a tray with parchment paper and place a 10x7 inch bottomless rectangular mold in the middle. Distribute half of the crumble on the bottom [14], be sure to create a nicely compact layer; pour the cream over it [15] and even it out with the back of a spoon.
End with another layer: distribute the remaining crumble [16] to cover the entire surface [17]. Place the dessert in the freezer and leave to cool for at least 3 hours. Once the time is up and the dessert is thoroughly frozen, gently heat the sides of the mold with a baking torch to make it easier to remove the dessert. If you don't have a baking torch you can use a hairdryer, or wait 2-3 minutes before running a knife blade along the edge to make it easier to remove the dessert from the mold [18]. 
Delicately lift the mold, be careful not to ruin the dessert [19]. Cut the dessert into cubes [20]: with these amounts we obtained 12 portions; leave the cream and strawberries dessert at room temperature for around 10 minutes, then it will be ready for you to enjoy [21]!
