Classic and timeless dessert lovers, do not miss our chance to prepare this soft spoke pattern apple cake. It is absolutely one of our favorites: at GialloZafferano we have dedicated many recipes to apple cakes each time adding different flavors and aromas, so we just had to try a butter free,Â gluten free and light one. An advantage of spoke pattern apple cake is that it requires little time to prepare, literally the same amount of time it takes to be devoured, thanks to the soft vanilla dough and juicy apple slices arranged in a spoke! A delicious and inviting dessert to finish your lunch with, but also a favorite treat served as a snack, as a sweet start to the day at breakfast, or for sharing in the office during an afternoon break. Treat your palate by serving this spoke pattern apple cake accompanied with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
