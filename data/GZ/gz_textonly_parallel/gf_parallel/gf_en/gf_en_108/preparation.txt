To prepare the spoke pattern apple cake, start by removing the vanilla seeds from the pod: cut it open lengthwise and remove the pulp with a knife [1]. Leave to one side for later and place the cold eggs [2], cold butter cut into small pieces [3],
add the sugar and vanilla seeds [4], and last of all, a pinch of salt [5]. Place the lid on the mixer and blend at a medium speed [6] to obtain a homogeneous batter.
Sieve the flour and baking powder in a bowl [7], then gradually add the powder to the mixture [8], alternate with the milk [9].
Continue blending to obtain a homogeneous batter [10]. Now prepare the apples: wash and dry them, cut them in half [11] and then into four wedges; remove the core [12] but not the peel.
Thinly slice each apple quarter using a mandolin [13]. If you do not have a mandolin, use a knife with a sharp blade to obtain thin slices. Butter and flour a 24 cm diameter tray. Now pour in the cake batter [14] and smooth the surface using a spatula [15] or rolling the tray, without banging it against the work top, which would deflate the batter, compromising leavening and baking.
Arrange 4 apple slices on the "cardinal points" of the mold [16], lightly press down on them so they sink slightly into the batter, continue arranging the other slices along the edge, next to each other, creating a spoke pattern [17]. At the center of the cake you can arrange the apple slices in a rose pattern [18].
Sprinkle some brown sugar over the cake [19]; once ready [20], bake in a conventional oven preheated to 360°F (182°C) for 50 minutes, on the lowest shelf. Once baked, remove from the oven [21], wait for it to cool, remove from the mold and serve your spoke pattern apple cake, if you prefer, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
