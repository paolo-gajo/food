To prepare pasta and zucchini, boil water in a large pan and add salt when it comes to a boil. In the meantime, wash and dry the zucchini [1], trim and grate them with an extra coarse grater [2]. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a fairly large pan and heat it over low heat together with a peeled garlic clove.
As soon as the oil is hot, add the zucchini [4] seasoned with salt and pepper and let them cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally; then remove the garlic [5]. In the meantime, cook the pasta in boiling salted water [6] and drain it al dente, keeping a little cooking water.
Pour the pasta directly into the pan with the zucchini and add a little cooking water [7], sweat for a few moments, stir, then turn off the heat. Add a few fragrant hand-torn basil leaves [8] and your pasta and zucchini is ready to be enjoyed [9].
