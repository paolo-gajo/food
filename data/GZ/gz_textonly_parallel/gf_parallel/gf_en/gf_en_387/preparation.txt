To prepare guacamole, start by peeling and finely chopping the onion [1]; finely chop the coriander too [2]. Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit [3].
Scoop the pulp out using a spoon and place it in a mortar [4]. Add the lime juice [5] and mash into a cream [6].
Now add the chopped onion [7] and the coriander [8]; mash to amalgamate some more and season with salt [9]. If you like spice, now is the time to add some fresh peperoncino or a few drops of tabasco.
Lastly, dice the tomatoes [10] and add them to the sauce [11]. Your guacamole is ready to be served [12]!
