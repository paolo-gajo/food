Did someone say "guacamole"? Then it must be a fiesta! The famous Mexican avocado sauce is a must served with nachos and is often use to fill delicious tortillas and fajitas too. Making it at home is very simple: apart from a ripe avocado, all you'll need is onion, lime, coriander and lastly, tomatoes, for a fresh touch! The authentic recipe involves the use of a molcajete, a typical mortar that will guarantee a soft yet rustic consistency. We used a pesto mortar, but a fork will do just as well. Now you know everything there is to know, all that's left is for you to decide how to serve your delicious guacamole!
