To make the Nutella tiramisu, start with the coffee: Prepare 1 cup (250 g) in a moka pot and set aside for it to cool. Move on to the syrup to pasteurize the egg yolks: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add ? cup (65 g) of the sugar and 3 tbsp (40 g) of water [1]. Heat up over moderate heat [2] until it reaches a temperature of 250°F (121°C) [3].
When the syrup has reached around 239°F (115°C), pour the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar into a bowl [4]. Using a hand mixer, start to whisk the eggs at low speed, and once the syrup has reached 250°F (121°F), pour it slowly into the eggs [5]. Increase the mixer speed slowly and continue to whisk the mixture until it’s completely cool and well whipped [6].
Next, add the mascarpone one or two spoonfuls at a time, still whisking with the mixer [7] until it’s all been added. Once you’ve got a smooth, fluffy cream without any lumps [8], turn off the mixer. The cream is ready to be used right away, although you can also leave it in the fridge for an hour or so. Pour the coffee into a dish to dip the ladyfingers into [9].
Once the coffee is no longer warm, take the cream out of the fridge and use it to create the first layer [10], using a 9x9 inch (24x24 cm) casserole dish. Dip the ladyfingers in the coffee quickly, wetting both sides [11], and arrange them in the casserole dish on top of the cream. Make sure the ladyfingers aren’t too wet, otherwise it will be difficult to spread the Nutella in the next step. You can also cut off any excess [12] if needed to make them fit in the dish correctly.
Add half of the Nutella [13] and, using a small spatula, spread over the entire surface. Next, cover with half of the mascarpone cream [14] and spread evenly using a spatula or spoon. Then repeat these steps: Dip the ladyfingers quickly in the coffee, add a layer of Nutella [15],
and then mascarpone cream [16]. The final touch is just adding a little sifted unsweetened cocoa powder [17] and some chopped hazelnuts on top. Your Nutella tiramisu is ready [18]!
