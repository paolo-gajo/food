Are batter and tempura your passion? Then you should definitely try coconut shrimps! With this recipe you will discover how to bring this tasty crustacean to the table, enhancing its goodness in a simple and original way. Shrimps are served with a unique breading, prepared with coconut flour, for a sweet and crunchy dish! The result will be a second course with an exotic taste, perfect also for an alternative finger food appetizer. In addition, the three accompanying sauces go perfectly with the delicate taste of the shimps: fake mayonnaise, made without eggs but with soy milk instead, is the great protagonist! Season it as you prefer, using paprika, garlic, ketchup or worcester sauce. At Giallozafferano, we have decided to give an ethnic touch with red Thai curry, and for those who prefer more delicate flavors, tomato paste! What are you waiting for? Try dipping your shrimp and choose the sauce that's right for you!
