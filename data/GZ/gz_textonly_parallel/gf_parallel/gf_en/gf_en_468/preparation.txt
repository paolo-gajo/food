To make the coconut shrimps, start by preparing the accompanying sauces. In a mixer bowl, pour seed oil [1], soy milk [2], and the squeezed and filtered lime juice [3].
Add a pinch of salt and blend everything [4] until the mixture thickens. Divide the sauce obtained into 3 bowls [5]. Leave one natural (it will be your fake mayonnaise) and flavor the other two. In one, add the tomato paste [6],
stirring with a teaspoon in order to mix everything well [7]. Let's prepare the second sauce, adding red Thai curry [8] to the last bowl and mix everything: your 3 sauces are ready [9].
Now let's clean the shrimps (alternatively you can use the prawns): remove the heads by applying a slight pressure with your hands between the head and the body [10]. Remove the legs [11] and extract the meat from the shell [12], but without detaching the tail.
Eliminate the intestine with the help of a toothpick or the tip of a small knife [13]. Then equip yourself with 3 trays: in the first pour rice flour, in the second break and beat the eggs and in the third place coconut flour. Once beaten, salt the eggs to taste [14] and dip each shrimp in rice flour [15].
Dip the shrimps in the beaten egg [16] and finally in the coconut flour [17]. Pour the seed oil in a high-sided pan and cook until it reaches a temperature of 340-350°F (170-180°C) (check with a kitchen thermometer) [18] .
Dip the shrimps in the boiling oil and let them fry for 1 minute [19]. Always fry a few at a time, so that the oil maintains the right temperature. When they turn golden brown, take the prawns out and drain on a tray covered with absorbent paper [20]. Transfer the coconut shrimps to a dish [21]. Your coconut shrimps are ready to be served hot, accompanied by the delicious sauces!
