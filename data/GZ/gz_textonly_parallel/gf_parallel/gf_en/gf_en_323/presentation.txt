We really are spoiled for choice as far as cheesecakes are concerned: baked or cold, mini or extra large, with mascarpone or ricotta or without cream for a lighter version. However, the New York cheesecake remains the undisputed queen of them all! The classic biscuit and butter base is smothered in a soft and enveloping cream made from cheese and cream. Gelatin will not be required, because the corn starch will thicken it when baked in the oven. Characterized by a high and thick edge, this iconic dessert is garnished with a sour cream and wild berry topping, in accordance with tradition. You can choose whatever topping you like however: chocolate or caramel sauce, or a simple layer of jelly: the New York cheesecake is bound to be a success!
