To make New York cheesecake, start by melting the butter and leave to cool until warm; in the meantime, place the biscuits in a mixer [1] and blend them into a powder [2]. Place them in a bowl and add the butter [3]. 
Stir with a spoon to obtain a uniform mixture [4]; now take a 86 in diameter spring cake mold and line the base with parchment paper. Add half of the biscuits and press down with the back of a spoon [6]. 
Use the remaining biscuits to line the edge of the mold [7]. Once you have covered the entire surface, leave the base for your New York cheesecake to harden in the refrigerator to for 30 minutes, or 15 minutes in the freezer. In the meantime, prepare the cream: take a bowl, add an egg, one yolk, the sugar [8] and whisk to make a cream [9]. 
Add the seeds of half a vanilla pod (save the rest for later) and add to the egg mix [11]. Gradually add the cream cheese [12] 
and continue to whisk [13]. Once you have incorporated all the cheese, add the lemon juice [14] and the cornstarch [15].
Now add the cream [16], delicately whisking all the while [17]. Remove the biscuit base from the refrigerator and pour the mixture over it [18]. 
Gently smooth the surface and bake in a static oven preheated to 320°F for 60 minutes, then at 340°F for another 20 minutes. Once baked, turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake to cool inside with the door open. In the meantime you can make the topping. Take a bowl, add the sour cream and the seeds of half a vanilla pod you saved for later; stir with a spatula. 
Add the topping to the cheesecake at room temperature and spread it evenly all over [22], before placing it back in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Once rested, remove the dessert from the mold [23] and decorate: first add the blackcurrants [24],
then the blackberries, blueberries and raspberries [25]. Last of all, add the mint leaves [26] and serve your fabulous New York cheesecake [27]!
