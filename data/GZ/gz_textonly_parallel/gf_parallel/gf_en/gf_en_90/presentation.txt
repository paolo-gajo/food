Stuffed frittata is a delicious second course to make the eggs taste more deliciously, even for children. It is a preparation that requires little time, but allows you to create a dish full of flavors, also ideal as a snack to take to a picnic out of town! By dividing the egg mixture in half, you will get two soft discs including a stringy heart of Emmentaler and delicious slices of cooked ham. But you can free your imagination for the filling and season the stuffed frittata as you prefer, perhaps varying with a filling of cheese and sautéed seasonal vegetables!
