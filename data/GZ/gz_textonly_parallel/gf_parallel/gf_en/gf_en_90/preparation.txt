To prepare the stuffed frittata, start by coarsely chopping the sprigs of chives [1] and slice the Emmentaler cheese [2]. Break the eggs and collect them in a large bowl [3],
beat them with a fork [4] and add the grated Grana Padano cheese [5], mix and add the sprigs of chives, salt and pepper [6] to taste.
Mix all the ingredients and divide the batter in two bowls [7]. In a 9 inch (24 cm) pan, pour a drizzle of oil [8] and heat it up well. Pour the contents of one of the two bowls [9],
cover with a lid [10] and cook over high heat for 2-3 minutes. Then flip the frittata with the help of the lid or a plate and slide it back into the pan [11]. Let it cook on the other side for another 2 minutes without the lid. Transfer the ready frittata on a plate [12] and keep it aside for a moment.
Grease another 9 inch (24 cm) diameter pan with a drizzle of oil [13], heat and repeat the same operations for the remaining eggs: pour the contents of the bowl into the pan [14] and cook for about 2 minutes with the cover; then turn it upside down with the help of the lid; cook the frittata on the other too [15].
Then distribute the slices of cheese on the surface of the frittata [16] and those of ham [17]. Place the frittata you prepared earlier with the part where the sprigs of chives are visible facing upwards [18].
Cover with the lid and cook for another 1-2 minutes [19], then gently unmold the frittata and place it on a tray [20] or a serving dish. You can slice the stuffed frittata [21] and serve it in wedges!
