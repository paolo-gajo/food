To make the panelle, first pour the chickpea flour into a large pot. Add the salt [1] and stir together while still dry. Now pour in nearly all the water slowly, saving the final part for the next step [2], and start to mix with a whisk [3] to prevent lumps from forming. Mix from the center outwards.
Slowly pour in the remaining water [4], whisking continuously [5]. The consistency will be fairly liquid at this point, but if you lift up a spoonful of the mixture, it should drizzle down, without being runny. Take the pot off the stove for the time it takes to chop the parsley roughly: The leaves should still be nearly intact [6].
Put the pot back on the heat and start stirring again, without stopping [7]. Once the flour starts to thicken, this is when the cooking really begins, so you’ll need to stir more vigorously. It will take around 30 minutes to get the right consistency. At that point, add the parsley [8] and stir again to distribute it evenly [9].
Once you’ve got an even mixture, turn off the heat [10]. Take a bit of the mixture and, using a spatula, spread it onto a marble work surface until it’s a little less than ¼ inch (4-5 mm) thick [11]. Let it cool slightly to make things easier. Trim the edges using a knife or dough cutter [12].
Try to get an exact rectangle around 2 inches (5 cm) tall [13]. Then, cut this into smaller rectangles around 4 inches (10 cm) long [14]. Repeat this step, spreading more of the mixture next to it and creating other panelle [15]. The quantities in this recipe will give you around 40 panelle.
Heat plenty of oil in a pot. Immerse a few panelle at a time [16] and cook them until they’re golden, turning them on both sides. It will take around 3 minutes. This will create the classic coating, making them crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Drain them [17] and transfer to paper towel [18].
Continue cooking this way [19]. Once all the panelle have been fried, you can choose whether to eat them on their own or use them to fill the bread rolls [20]. In this case, we recommend using 5 panelle per roll. Whatever you choose, we recommend eating them while they’re still piping hot [21]!
