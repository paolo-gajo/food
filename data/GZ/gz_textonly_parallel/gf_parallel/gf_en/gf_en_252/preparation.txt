To make the pasta with zucchini carbonara sauce, first wash and trim the zucchini, then cut into sticks [1] and dice [2]. Meanwhile, bring a saucepan full of salted water to a boil, which you will use to cook the pasta. Heat some olive oil [3] in a frying pan.
Add the zucchini [4] and brown for around 6-7 minutes over high heat; they should remain crunchy. Pour the egg yolks and Pecorino cheese [5] into a bowl and whisk [6].
Add one ladleful of cooking water from the pasta [7] and stir to get a creamy mix [8]. In the meantime, cook the pasta for the time stated on the package [9].
Season the browned zucchini [10] with salt and pepper, and when the pasta is ready, transfer it directly into the frying pan [11] using a slotted spoon. With the heat off, add the egg yolk and cheese mix [12].
Stir to combine [13], then serve the pasta with zucchini carbonara sauce [14], garnishing the dishes with Pecorino shavings to taste [15].
