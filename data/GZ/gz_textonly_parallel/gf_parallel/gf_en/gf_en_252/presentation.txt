Spaghetti alla carbonara: this is the first culinary stop that usually happens on a visit to Rome! Guanciale, Pecorino cheese, and eggs come together with spaghetti – the classic pasta shape – to form a creamy, delicious, time-honored dish. But there’s more than just the traditional way to prepare this dish, meaning you can make a different version every time. We’ve already tempted you with an artichoke and pancetta version. This time, we invite you to try another tasty vegetarian twist that uses bow tie pasta instead of spaghetti, as its shape is perfect for catching the egg and diced zucchini used to give the dish a lighter, more delicate flavor. Pasta with zucchini carbonara sauce is perfect if you’re looking for a flavorful vegetarian appetizer or a meal for your kids – the fun shape of the pasta will mean they won’t even notice the vegetables!
