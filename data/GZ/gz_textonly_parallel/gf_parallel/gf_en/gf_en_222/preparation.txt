To make pork arista with milk, first of all peel and julienne the onions [1]. Heat a generous drizzle of oil in a pan, add the onions [2], a pinch of salt, and cook on a low flame [3].
In the meantime, massage the larded arista, already tied with string and skewered with a rosemary sprig, with the salt [4]. Brown the meat in another pan, with a drizzle of oil [5]. Thoroughly seal the sides together and leave to one side [6].
Deglaze the cooking sauce with the wine [7], simmer and reduce slightly, just enough for the alcohol to evaporate. Pour the resulting liquid into the pan with the onions [8], together with the sage and laurel [9].
Add the arista [10] and the milk [11], then cover with the lid and cook on a medium-low flame for 70 minutes [12].
Once the cooking time is over [13], remove the meat from the pan and leave to one side hot, covered with plastic wrap. Remove the aromatic herbs and blend the bottom with an immersion mixer [14], then add the butter [15] and stir; if the consistency is still very liquid, reduce it some more, for ten minutes or so, on a medium flame.
You should now have a thick and creamy sauce [16]. Remove the string and cut the meat into slices [17]; your pork arista with milk is ready to be served with its sauce [18]!
