To prepare cashew chicken, place the cashews in a pan [1] and toast them on a high flame for a few minutes [2]. Rinse the leek under running water and remove the outermost leaves, then tip both the end with the root and the end with the dark green leaves, thinly slice [3] and leave it to one side.
Now prepare the chicken breast: cut it into cubes [4], place inside a colander and add the rice flour [5]; thoroughly coat the chicken pieces in the flour, stir and shake the colander to remove the excess flour; leave the flour-coated chicken pieces to one side. Place a large pan on the stove and heat the olive oil on a low flame [6],
flavor with the fresh grated ginger [7], squeeze and add a garlic clove [8], then add the chicken [9]. 
Brown the chicken for a few minutes on a medium flame, then drizzle with the soy sauce [10], add the sliced leek [11] and the water, simmer and reduce [12].
Cook for another 10 minutes to reduce the sauce. Lastly, add the toasted cashews [13] and salt to taste (be sure to taste as soy sauce is salty) [14]. Serve the chicken with cashews nice and hot [15]!
