To make the pumpkin and sausage risotto, start by peeling the shallot, then slice it thinly [1] and set it aside. Take the sausage, cut the casing with a small knife and gently pull it with your hands to remove it [2], then chop the meat with a knife [3].
Cut the pumpkin into slices, remove the peel [4] and reduce the pulp into cubes by half a centimeter [5]. Transfer the diced pumpkin to a bowl, season with olive oil [6],
paprika [7], salt and pepper. Stir to flavor, then pour the seasoned pumpkin on a baking sheet and place some sprigs of rosemary [8]. Bake in a preheated convection oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. While the pumpkin is cooking, take care of the risotto: heat 1.5 tbsp (20 g) of butter in a pan and add the chopped shallot [9].
Stew the shallot with a ladle of broth [10] for about 5 minutes, so as to soften it, then pour in the rice [11]. Toast it for 1 minute, then pour the sausage [12].
When the sausage has browned, add the white wine [13], let it evaporate and then continue cooking by adding the broth as needed [14] a little at a time, stirring the rice often. Cook the rice for about 18-20 minutes. Meanwhile, once the pumpkin has cooked, take it out of the oven and remove the sprigs of rosemary [15].
Once the risotto is cooked, turn off the heat and pour the pumpkin cubes [16], taking care to leave a handful aside for the decoration of the dishes. Stir in the grated Parmesan [17] and 2 tbsp (30 g) of butter [18].
The risotto is ready [19], transfer it to serving dishes garnishing with the pumpkin kept aside [20]. Serve your pumpkin and sausage risotto hot [21].
