To prepare pasta Marinara, start by cleaning seafood. Start byÂ cleaning the clams. First of all, make sure there are no broken or empty shells and discard them immediately. Now beat them against a cutting board to eliminate any sand inside [1]. Place the clams in a colander over a bowl and rinse them [2]. Place the colander in another bowl, fill with water and add abundant coarse salt, to recreate a sort of sea water. Leave the clams to soak for 2-3 hours [3]. This will flush out any remaining sand.
Now clean the mussels. Rinse them under running water. Take a small knife and remove any encrustations [4] and vigorously remove the beard, or byssus, emerging from the valve [5]. Once more, under fresh running water and using a steel scrub pad, energetically rub the mussels to remove any impurities [6].
Now for the scallops. Remove them from the shell [7], but don't throw it away because we will use it for decorating. Eliminate the coral [8] and leave to one side [9].
Take the red king prawns, leave the head on and remove the shell [10], then make a delicate incision on the back [11] and devein [12] to remove the sandiest part.
Now take the pink shrimps, remove the shell and leave the head on [13]. Now arrange the scampi on a cutting board and cut them in half (both body and head) [14]. Leave the tail part closed and prize apart the head part [15], to unleash more flavor in the sauce, and remove the sandy vein [16].
