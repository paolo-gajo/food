Contaminated by his father Vittorio's passion for cuisine, Chef Enrico Cerea grew up among pots, pans and stoves. Today we had the honor of hosting him in our kitchen and he decided to prepare one of his first recipes, perhaps the one that launched his career. Pasta Marinara is a recipe of simple, yet intense flavors...a dish for sharing with all the family, on a special occasion! The secret to a starred dish lies in the selection of ingredients: seafood must be fresh and not overcooked; this is the only way to guarantee a tender and juicy preparation! A scenographic and genuine dish that will impress your guests!?
