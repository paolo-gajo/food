Among our traditional street food recipes, gnocco fritto (fried dough) is a very popular classic of Emilian cuisine. It is an ancient recipe whose origins seem to date back to the domination of the Lombards, who used a lot of lard in their dishes, especially for frying. The original recipe for fried dough requires frying in lard, but nowadays oil is the preferred alternative. Fried dough is very easy to prepare, you just need a little patience to knead the ingredients: flour, water, milk, lard and yeast. It can be enjoyed hot, once fried and slightly cooled, accompanied by cold cuts and, perhaps, a good glass of Lambrusco. Despite the fact that there is only one recipe, in Emilia, gnocco fritto has taken on different names according to the various areas: in the province of Bologna gnocco fritto is called "crescentina", in the province of Parma "torta fritta", in the province of Reggio Emilia and Modena "gnocco fritto", while in the province of Piacenza it is known as "chisul√®n". Although fried dumplings have taken on different names over time, their deliciousness has remained intact!
