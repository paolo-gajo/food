Say goodbye to complicated recipes when time is short, but never compromise on flavor! For salad lovers, even in winter, you can find delightful combinations of ingredients like cabbage or the aromatic pairing of orange and fennel. There are many salad versions starring these two ingredients, with the Sicilian version featuring olives and red onions being a notable example. Today, we're excited to share one that has captivated us with its lightness: the Fennel and Orange Salad. Oranges and fennel unite with the crunch of pumpkin seeds and pine nuts, seasoned with the aroma of raisins and a light dressing that adds a swirl of fruity notes to this tantalizing side dish. It's a refreshing alternative to the classic pan-fried, baked, or au gratin fennel! Are you already drooling? It's true, salads have never been this enticing!
