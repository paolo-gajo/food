To prepare the fennel and orange salad, start by squeezing the juice of 1 orange [1] and soaking the raisins [2] in the juice obtained: let them rehydrate this way for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the other orange [3] and remove both ends. Be careful to eliminate the bitter white part of the peel.
Slice it into very thin slices [4] and set aside. Proceed by washing and drying the fennel. Place it on a cutting board and remove the stalks and green fronds with a clean cut [5]. Also remove the base and the tougher, woodier outer leaves. Then cut its heart into very thin julienne strips using a mandoline [6].
Transfer it into a bowl with acidulated water to preserve its color until use [7]. Now pour the pine nuts into a non-stick pan [8] and toast them [9] for a few minutes: set them aside to cool down.
In the meantime, the raisins will have been rehydrated: drain them [10] and set them aside, while you pour the juice into a container with high sides [11], adding the vinegar [12].
Add the oil [13] and adjust the salt [14]: blend all the ingredients with an immersion blender.
You will need to obtain a homogeneous emulsion [16]. At this point, you will have all the ingredients ready to compose your salad: drain the fennel [17] and pour them into a large bowl to which you will add the raisins [18].
Â Add the oranges [19], seasoning with the emulsion you have obtained [20] and the pine nuts [21].
Add a crunchy note by pouring in pumpkin seeds [22] and mix well all the ingredients [23]. Your fennel and orange salad is now ready to be served [24]!
