To prepare the fruit and chocolate puff pastry, start by taking a round oven tray, or the base of a 12 inch (30 cm) diameter mold. Cover with a sheet of parchment paper cut to the same size [1], unroll a sheet of puff pastry and spread the strawberry jam over it with a teaspoon [2]. Chop the dark chocolate, not too finely [3]
Wash and destalk the strawberries [4], then cut them into slices [5]; peel and cut the banana into oblique slices, roughly 5 mm in size [6].
Arrange the chopped chocolates into spokes, create 6 starting from the middle [7]; distribute the banana slices over it, then the strawberry slices over the banana ones [8]. Place the second disc of puff pastry on top and close it [9].
Carefully seal by pressing down on the spaces without fruit [10], then slice into the pastry between one spoke of fruit and the other, starting from around 3-4 cm from the middle all the way out to the edge [11], now fold a cut corner towards the inside of the slice [12];
proceed in the same way with the other part, folding it over [13] and making sure both fit as best as possible [14]. Once the puff pastry wreathe is ready [15],
beat the egg [16], dab it all over the wreathe using a brush [17], then sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over the middle [18]
and the sugar over the spokes (19-20); bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 25 minutes, on the middle shelf. Once the fruit and chocolate puff pastry is ready, remove from the oven [21], leave to cool and then serve!
