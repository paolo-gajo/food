The pineapple upside-down cake is a soft fruit cake in which pineapple, a fruit loved by young and old alike, plays the leading role! The "inverted" baking method, with the fruit underneath instead of on top of the cake, gives the desserts a scenic appearance and sophisticated taste, such as in our pineapple upside-down cupcakes and the banana upside-down cake. The special feature of the pineapple upside-down cake is the bittersweet taste of caramel that blends with the freshness of the pineapple, creating a contrast of delicious flavors that goes well with the delicacy of the cake. The pineapple upside-down cake is a very versatile dessert that is suitable for breakfast, a snack, but also perfect as a dessert, perhaps served while still warm with a delicious scoop of cream-flavored ice cream or whipped cream. Your guests will ask for seconds!
