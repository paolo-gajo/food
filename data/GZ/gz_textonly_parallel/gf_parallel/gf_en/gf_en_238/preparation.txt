To make the pineapple upside-down cake, first clean the pineapple (you will need 23 oz (650 g) in total): remove the base, cut off the green top [1]  and remove the skin (2-3).
Now remove the center core (4-5) with a special coring  tool. Cut 12 oz (350 g)  [6] of the pineapple into thin slices.
Then reduce them into quarters [7]  and set  them aside, they will be used to cover the base of the cake pan. Dice the remaining 11 oz (300 g) of pineapple [8]. Use a cake pan with a 9.5-inch (24 cm) diameter at the top and an 8.5-inch (22 cm) diameter at the bottom, with a 2-inch (5 cm) high edge. Pour the water and sugar [9] in and place over medium heat
until brown, then turn off the heat and add the chopped butter [10]  and stir. Now lay the previously cut pineapple slices in a spiral shape [11]. You will have to completely cover the bottom [12].
Set aside and prepare the cake dough: in a bowl, pour the soft, chopped butter, sugar [13]  and salt [14]. Whip the mixture with an electric whisk and add the whole eggs one at a time [15].
While whipping at low speed, add the flour 00 [16], baking powder [17] and, once absorbed, alternate the almond flour [18] 
and almond milk [19]. Once you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, add the diced pineapple [20]. Pour the dough into the cake pan [21].
Level the surface with a spatula (22-23) and bake in a static oven preheated to 365° F (185° C) for one hour. Once ready, take the cake out of the oven, use a knife to delicately detach the cake from the pan [24]
and turn it over on a rack while it is still hot [25] so that the excess caramel drips out, then remove the pan without burning yourself [26]. Let your pineapple upside-down cake [27] cool and then serve!
