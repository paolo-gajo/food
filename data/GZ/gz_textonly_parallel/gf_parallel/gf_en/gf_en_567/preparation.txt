To prepare the baked pasta, start with the mix for the meatballs. First take the sausage, cut it in half [1] and remove the casing [2]. Then coarsely chop the meat with a knife [3].
In a larger bowl pour the ground meat and add the sausage [4], the grated Parmesan cheese [5], chopped parsley and bread crumbs previously crumbled in the mixer [6].
Then add the eggs [7] and season with salt and pepper. Work the dough with your hands [8] until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. Cover it with transparent wrap and let it rest until the meatballs are prepared. Then, start preparing the sauce: in a large non-stick pan add the oil, a whole clove of garlic and a finely chopped onion [9].
When the oil is hot, pour in the tomato puree [10]. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 30 minutes covered over low heat [11], stirring occasionally. In the meantime, roll the meatballs about 1tbsp (10 g) each [12] and place them on a plate. 
This mixture will yield about 70 meatballs [13]. After the cooking time of the sauce, remove the garlic clove [14] and pour the meatballs into the sauce [15].
Add salt and pepper and stir with a spatula. Let it simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Then add the chopped basil leaves [16] and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Finally, prepare the eggs. Boil them for at least 8-10 minutes [17], then cool them under cold running water. Once they are cold, peel the boiled eggs and cut them into slices with a special tool or a sharp knife [18] and set them aside in a bowl.
Cut the scamorza cheese into slices, then into strips, then into cubes. Put it in a bowl and set it aside. Now prepare the béchamel sauce: heat the milk in a small saucepan [20]. Heat the butter chunks in a separate pan and let them melt over low heat. Turn off the heat and add the flour to the melted butter, stirring vigorously with a hand whisk to prevent lumps from forming [21]. Put the saucepan back over low heat and cook the cream until it is a golden brown: in this way you will get a roux.
Then add the milk, which is now hot, and season with nutmeg and salt. Cook the béchamel for 5-6 minutes over low heat until it thickens, continuing to stir with the hand whisk [22]. Transfer the béchamel into a bowl and cover it with transparent wrap until it is used to prevent forming a crust on the surface. Boil the pasta in plenty of salted water [23] and drain halfway through cooking [24].
Take the meatball sauce, now ready [25], and add it to the pasta [26]. Mix the ingredients well with a spoon [27].
Then spread a veil of béchamel on the bottom of an ovenproof dish [28] and create a first layer of rigatoni pasta and meatballs [29]. Spread half the boiled egg slices on top of the pasta [30]
and half of the diced scamorza cheese [31] then sprinkle with half of the grated Parmesan cheese [32]. Season the first layer with a few tablespoons of béchamel sauce [33] and proceed with the second layer of pasta and meatballs ,distributing it evenly over the first. Complete the layer with evenly spread egg slices.
Sprinkle with diced scamorza cheese [34] and béchamel [35]. Sprinkle with the remaining grated Parmesan cheese [35] and bake at 180° in a static oven for about 15 minutes (or ventilated at 160°C for 7 minutes). After cooking, set the oven function to broil and leave for about 5 minutes. The baked pasta is ready: let it rest at room temperature 5-10 minutes before eating [36].
