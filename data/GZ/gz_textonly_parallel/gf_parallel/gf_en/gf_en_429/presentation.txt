The most classic ice cream and the easiest to prepare at home is certainly fiordilatte ice cream. With its creamy texture and delicate taste it goes well with all other flavors, such as chocolate and fruit. It is irresistible even in winter, maybe with warm zabaione (egg cream), with marron glacé or with nougat crumbs at Christmas time! Whatever the season or occasion you want to enjoy it in, the first thing to do is to choose the best ingredients. The type of milk used makes the difference, it is the starting point to obtain an excellent product, as explained by chef Ugo Alciati who has created a fiordilatte ice cream with few ingredients: his milk is obtained strictly from Piedmontese white cows that produce only 9-10 quarts per day compared to the 60-70 quarts from a traditional farm, ensuring a superior, rich, nutritious, and tasty product. Vanilla seeds, carob powder, fresh cream and sugar are added to it. In addition to excellent ingredients which are wisely blended, rest times are also important to make a good ice cream... but we do not want to reveal too much! You will discover step by step everything you need to do to achieve a special taste and perfectly creamy texture! If you want to add a gourmet touch to this recipe, as suggested by chef Alciati, you can serve fiordilatte ice cream with an apricot coulis and a cascade of chocolate crumbs.
