A recipe with a kiss! It could not be otherwise for these little sweets, the baci di dama, so called because the two halves of cookie are held together by a layer of chocolate, like two mouths trying to sweetly kiss each other. Who has not encountered or never had the opportunity to taste these sweets from the city of Tortona, in Piedmont? In the beginning, baci di dama (hazelnut cookies) were made with hazelnuts, which are easier to find and cheaper than almonds, which were introduced later by Tortona confectioners to perfect the recipe. However, there are versions with almonds and hazelnuts or just one of the two nuts, as we are proposing to you from the Master Pastry Chef Iginio Massari.
