Neapolitan pizza is one of the most classic and tasty pizzas ever. It is made with a base of pizza dough, seasoned with tomato puree scented with oregano and enriched with anchovies in oil and caper berries that give the pizza a strong flavor. In order not to cover the taste of these simple ingredients that bring us back to the flavors of the past, Neapolitan pizza was made without the addition of mozzarella, so it is also suitable for those who are lactose intolerant. For a richer flavor, however, try Roman pizza, topped with mozzarella!Â
