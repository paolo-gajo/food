To prepare the pizza dough, start by pouring the flour into the bowl of a mixer [1]. Add the yeast [2] and 100 grams of water, then turn on the mixer fitted with the hook at medium low speed [3].
Proceed adding the water gradually, ensuring each addition is well absorbed by the flour before adding the next [4]. Once you have poured about 3/4 of the water, add the salt [5] and continue kneading. Add the rest of the water in a thin stream and let it knead until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous [6].
Now add the oil gradually (as you did with the water) [7]. When the oil has been completely absorbed, take the dough out of the mixer bowl and shape it into a ball with your hands [8]. Place it in a large, slightly oiled bowl [9].
Cover with film or a clean cloth and leave to rise in the oven with the light on [10]. Wait until the dough has at least doubled its volume (1.5 h), even better, tripled (2.5/3 h) and proceed with the preparation of the pizzas [11]. Once the dough has risen, transfer it to the pastry board and divide it into 4 equal parts [12].
Roll each part into a ball [13]. Cover with a clean cloth and leave to rest for 30 minutes [14]. Lightly oil 4 12-inch (30 cm) pizza pans. Place a small ball of dough [15] in the center of each pizza pan.
and start pressing from the center outwards, pulling the sides slightly if necessary [16]. If the dough is too elastic and tends to return to its previous shape, put aside the pizza you're rolling out and proceed to roll out another one, letting the previous one rest. Try to spread the dough over the entire surface of the pizza pan [17]. Separately, in a large bowl, pour the tomato sauce and season it with salt, oil, pepper and oregano [18].
Pour a generous ladle of tomato sauce on the base of the pizza [19] and spread it in a circular motion, covering almost the entire area, leaving only a 2/3-inch (1.5 cm) rim [20]. Cut the caper berries in half [21] and put them aside.
Now season with the anchovies [22], caper berries cut in half and a drizzle of oil [23]. Let the seasoned pizza rest for about ten minutes, then bake at 400째F (210째C) for 15/20 minutes in a static oven (370째F (190째C) if you use a convection oven for about 15 minutes). As soon as you take the Neapolitan pizza out of the oven, serve it immediately [24].
