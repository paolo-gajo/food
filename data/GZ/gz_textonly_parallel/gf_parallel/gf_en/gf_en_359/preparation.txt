To prepare the lemon tiramisu, the first thing you need to do is make the ladyfingers. Separate the eggs (you'll need 1.7 oz of yolks and 3.3 oz of whites); transfer the yolks into the bowl of a stand mixer. Add half of the sugar slowly [1] and begin to beat the yolks and sugar at medium speed. As soon as they become foamy, add the grated zest of two untreated lemons [2] and continue to work them until they are well whipped [3].
Keep the beaten egg yolks aside and whisk the 3.3 oz of egg whites, gradually adding the remaining sugar (4-5) when they have slightly swelled. Once finished, sift the flour [6] into the mixture with the yolks
and the potato starch [7]. Gently mix with a spatula from the bottom to the top [8], and as soon as you have obtained a lump-free mixture, add the whipped egg whites, always working gently with the spatula from top to bottom [9].
Gently mix until you obtain a smooth and foamy mixture [10]; then transfer it into a pastry bag equipped with a smooth tip [11] and use it to create sticks approximately 3'' long on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [12]. With these amounts, you will obtain 20 sticks.
Dust each ladyfinger first with granulated sugar [13] and then with powdered sugar [14]. Then bake the ladyfingers in a preheated static oven at 390°F for about 10-12 minutes. Once cooked, take them out of the oven [15] and let them cool completely.
In the meantime, take care of preparing the lemon tiramisu cream. Firstly, transfer the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spatula to soften it. Then, in another bowl, whip the fresh liquid cream together with the sugar [16]. At this point, gradually add the whipped cream and sugar mixture to the mascarpone cheese [17] and mix with a spatula from the bottom to the top [18] to combine the two components.
Then add the grated zest of an untreated lemon [19] and mix again to combine everything [20]. Transfer to a disposable pastry bag without a nozzle [21] and refrigerate.
Now you can prepare the syrup for the ladyfingers: pour the lemon juice [22], sugar [23], and water [24] into a bowl. Mix everything together.
At this point, prepare 4 jars. If the ladyfingers are shorter than the jars, simply cut off a small piece [25] and use them to alternate with the layers of cream. Quickly soak the ladyfingers [26] and arrange them in a circular pattern, pressing them against the edge of each jar [27].
Once you have covered the entire inner rim [28], resume with the cream and pipe it into the center of each glass with a pastry bag until it is about half full [29]. Lightly soak the remaining pieces of ladyfingers in the syrup [30]
and place them in the center of the small glass [31]. Top with more cream [32] and garnish with grated lemon zest. Your lemon tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed [33]!
