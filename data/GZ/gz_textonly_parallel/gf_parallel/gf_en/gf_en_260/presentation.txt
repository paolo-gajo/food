It’s always hard to say no to a dish of pasta, but practically impossible when the sauce is irresistible, as is the case with pasta with mushrooms and sausage! We have tried a more autumnal version with mushrooms, sausage, and crumbled chestnuts, and used the same ingredients as a filling for paccheri pasta! Today we are celebrating this heavenly combination in its pure form, embellished with just a little cream. And we opted for the trofie pasta shape to make this dish even more special. Trofie are ideal for this type of sauce because they sauté beautifully in the pan and scoop up all the wonderful ingredients, forkful after forkful.
