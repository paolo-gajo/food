To prepare trofie pasta with sausages and mushrooms, start by cleaning the mushrooms. Firstly, slice through the base to remove the earthy part [1]. Then wipe the whole mushroom gently using a damp cloth. We also recommend using a special mushroom cleaning brush if needed [2]. When all the mushrooms are clean, cut them into slices a few millimeters thick [3].
Now itâ€™s time to cook them. Heat a little oil in a saucepan and add an unpeeled garlic clove for flavor. As soon as the base of the pan is hot, crumble in a sausage without its skin [4]. Let the meat brown gently and then turn up the heat before adding the mushrooms [5]. Fry the mushrooms too, and remove the garlic clove [6] when the mushrooms begin to give up their liquid.
Remove the leaves from a sprig of rosemary and add to the pan [7]. A few minutes later, when the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated, deglaze with white wine [8]. Season with salt and pepper, turn the heat down and bring the pasta water to a boil [9].
As soon as the water is boiling, add the trofie pasta [10]. In the meantime, pour the cream into a pan with the flavoring and grind in a little more pepper [11]. As soon as the trofie pasta is cooked, drain them while still in the pan [12].
Add pasta cooking water as needed to achieve a sauce of the desired consistency [13], making sure to mix well [14]. Dish up and serve the trofie with sausage and mushrooms as soon as they are ready [15]!
