To make the chocolate lava cake, first chop the chocolate coarsely with a knife, then put it in a bain-marie, or place the bain-marie on a pan filled with water [1]. Mix with a rubber spatula to help melt it and when the chocolate has melted, add the butter [2], stir until it has completely combined. Once ready, turn off the burner and keep the bain-marie aside with the melted chocolate, perhaps placing it on a clean cloth. Meanwhile, pour the eggs and yolk into a bowl, add the powdered sugar [3] and the seeds from the vanilla pod;
Beat with a mixer [4] until it is clear and frothy, then pour in the melted chocolate [5] and continue to combine the thoroughly [6].
At this point, add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture: sift the flour [7] and the cocoa powder [8] then mix with a spatula to combine the ingredients [9].
The mixture is ready, take some 3" (8 cm) wide and 1 1/2" (4 cm) deep round aluminum molds, butter the bottoms and the sides and then sprinkle with brown sugar (alternatively you can use cocoa powder or powdered sugar). Pour the chocolate mixture into the molds 2/3 full [11], then bake in a static oven preheated to 350° F (180° C) for 13-15 minutes. When the time is up, take your cakes out right away [12].
Turn them upside down on a serving plate still hot taking care not to burn yourself [13], finish by sprinkling the chocolate lava cake with powdered sugar [14] and serve immediately [15]!
