To make the apple fritters, start with the batter: Whisk two whole eggs in a bowl, then add the milk [1] and a pinch of salt [2]. Next, sift the flour into the bowl [3].
Sift the baking powder into the bowl too [4], and then whisk everything together thoroughly by hand [5] until you get a uniform mixture without any lumps [6].
Once the batter is ready [7], set aside. Juice one lemon, which you’ll use to keep the apple slices [8] from getting discolored. Now, peel the apples using a vegetable peeler to remove as little flesh as possible [9].
Remove the core using an apple corer [10]. You can also cut the apples in half to remove the core more easily if you don’t have a corer. Cut the apple into slices around ¼ inch (5 mm) thick [11] and lay them one on top of another in a large, shallow container [12].
Sprinkle the apple slices with the lemon juice so they don’t get discolored [13]. Now, turn to the frying: Pour the oil into a large pot and, using a kitchen thermometer, bring the oil to around 340°F (170°F) without going above this temperature. At this point, you can dip a slice of apple into the batter [14], making sure to cover the whole slice completely, and fry it in the hot oil [15].
Only fry up to two slices at a time to ensure the oil stays hot. You can turn the apple fritters while they’re cooking using a slotted spoon, to get them to brown evenly [16]. As they’re ready, arrange them on a tray lined with paper towel to remove the excess oil [17]. In a bowl, combine 2½ tbsp (30 g) of sugar with cinnamon powder to taste [18].
Mix together [19] and then sprinkle the fritters with the flavored sugar [20]. Your apple fritters are ready to eat, still hot or warm [21]!
