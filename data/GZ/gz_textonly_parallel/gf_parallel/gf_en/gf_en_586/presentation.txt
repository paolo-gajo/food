If there’s one traditional product from the Trentino-Alto Adige region that stands out, it’s apples. Grown all along the valleys, they dot the landscape with their different colors. In this recipe, we’ve sliced them and dipped them in a creamy batter to create some delicious apple fritters! The result? Fragrant fritters that are soft and juicy on the inside, flavored with the elegant, spiced note of the cinnamon. Perfect for serving as a snack or dessert, apple fritters go great with savory dishes too, especially those based around pork. Quick and easy to prepare, you’ll only a few simple ingredients including flour, milk, eggs, and sugar, although be sure to try the version with ricotta or even a more exotic one with pineapple. For those with a serious sweet tooth, on the other hand, we suggest having the apple fritters along with some pastry cream, chocolate, or whipped cream... an explosion of delicious sweetness!
