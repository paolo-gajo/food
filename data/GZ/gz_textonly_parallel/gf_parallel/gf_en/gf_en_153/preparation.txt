When preparing the sautéed mushrooms, the first step is to clean the different types of mushrooms and fungi. We’ve used porcini mushrooms, champignon mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, and chanterelles in this recipe. Start with the porcini mushrooms: Remove the soil with a brush [1] or dry cloth [2]. Cut off the earthy part of the stalk with a small knife [3]. Clean the other mushrooms in the same way. If they are very dirty, you can run them quickly under the faucet, but be careful because mushrooms absorb a lot of water.
Slice the porcini mushrooms [4], champignons [5], and chanterelles thinly [6].
Slice the oyster mushrooms as well [7]. Heat the butter with the oil [8] and a halved garlic clove [9] in a non-stick frying pan.
Season the mushrooms. Add the firmest porcini mushrooms [10] to the pan, sauté over high heat for a couple of minutes and then add the other mushrooms [11]. Cook for a couple more minutes over high heat, stirring gently all the time to prevent the mushrooms from coming apart as they cook. Season with salt [12]
and pepper [13]. Add the finely chopped parsley [14]. Remove from the heat and serve the sautéed mushrooms hot or cold, depending on your menu [15].
