To prepare the soft chocolate tart, put the butter out of the refrigerator and make sure it is soft before starting the preparation. At this point, chop the dark chocolate [1], place it in a bowl [2] and melt it in a bain-marie [3]; alternatively you can use the microwave, just activate it for a few seconds at a time and mix gradually so that it does not burn.
With the heat off, add the diced butter [4] and mix vigorously [5] to mix it completely [6].
Keep aside and whisk the eggs adding the sugar [7] little by little [8]. It will take about 10 minutes to get a clear and puffy mixture. At this point add the melted chocolate with the butter [9].
Continue to work everything at medium speed [10]. Now sift the flour and baking powder directly into the bowl [11] and incorporate the powders with an electric whisk, this time at low speed [12].
As soon as you have obtained a uniform mixture [13], transfer it into the previously buttered and floured 9" (24 cm) mold on the surface and 8.66" (22 cm) on the base. Level the surface [15] and cook in a preheated static oven at 355°F (180°C) for 30 minutes.
Once the cake is cooked (always do the toothpick test) take it out of the oven [16], let it cool down then turn it upside down on a serving plate [17]. Gently lift the mold, let it cool [18] and in the meantime prepare the ganache cream.
Pour the cream into a saucepan [19] and bring it to the boil. Meanwhile, finely chop the milk chocolate [20] and transfer it to a bowl. As soon as the cream is hot, pour a small amount on the chocolate [21].
Mix immediately [22], then add the remaining cream in 2 times [23] and continue to mix gently until the mixture is smooth, taking care not to incorporate air [24]. Put the ganache in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes so that it reaches the right texture.
At this point, pour the ganache into the cavity of the cake [25] and distribute it evenly over the entire surface [26]. Decorate with berries and mint leaves and serve your soft chocolate tart [27].
