Once upon a time there was the classic tart, then the soft one and today we want to tell you about another variant: the soft chocolate tart! This version is terribly greedy because the chocolate is the real protagonist of this dessert. In fact it is present in the soft base and in the cover which is based on milk chocolate ganache. As for the classic one, the soft chocolate tart is cooked inside the very famous "smart mold". This particular mold has a slightly raised bottom, this way the soft tart will have a perfect cavity to be filled with the cream you love most!
