Mascarpone, coffee, and ladyfingers: three ingredients for a unique and inimitable dessert, tiramisu! Who hasn't brought it to the table at least once? Soft, fluffy, and with the unmistakable aroma of coffee, it pleases everyone! Today, however, we propose an alternative version: ricotta tiramisu. An equally creamy variant that sees the addition of cow's milk ricotta instead of the more common mascarpone. Also, the satisfaction of making ladyfingers at home, fragrant and genuine, soaked in coffee to alternate with the layers of ricotta cream, is a contributing factor. We are sure that the ricotta tiramisu will enter the list of your alternative tiramisus!
