To prepare your chicken meatballs, first separate the bones of the cooked chicken from the meat and remove the skin [1]; you can use either the breast or the thighs. Next, pull apart the pieces of meat with your hands (2-3). 
Add the egg [4], breadcrumbs [5], and Parmigiano cheese [6].
Add the oregano leaves [7] and a pinch of salt and pepper, and mix everything together with your hands [8] until the mixture is nicely dense. Next, cut the mozzarella into small pieces. Take a portion of the meat mixture, bearing in mind that you will need to make 9 meatballs, and flatten it in the palm of your hand to form a shell [9]. 
Place a couple of pieces of mozzarella in the center [10], and seal the mixture around it to form the meatball [11]. Repeat this process for the others and arrange them on a tray lined with parchment paper [12]. 
Next, beat the egg in a small bowl, pour the breadcrumbs into another, and heat the oil until it reaches a temperature of 340°F (170°C). Once the oil is hot, dip each meatball first in the egg [13] and then in the breadcrumbs [14]. Fry the meatballs for a couple of minutes maximum [15], until golden brown,
then use a skimmer to drain the meatballs from the oil [16], and transfer them to a paper towel. Season with salt [17] and serve your meatballs while still hot [18]!
