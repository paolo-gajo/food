Sausage and zucchini are two very different ingredients, but create a unique flavor when combined! Pasta with zucchini and sausage is the perfect dish for a family lunch: nourishing and quick to prepare, it will satisfy everyone's tastes. The strong flavor of sausage pairs well with the delicate flavor of zucchini and the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes, while rosemary adds a pungent note to the dish. We chose to serve this rich condiment with farfalle, the perfect pasta shape for adding a creative and vibrant touch to any dish. If your vegetable patch is brimming with zucchini then this is the perfect time to make this delicious pasta with zucchini and sausage! For other summer versions, try sausage and eggplantsÂ or sausage and peppers! Or, if you are looking for stronger flavors, then you simply must try pasta with sausage and beer.
