To prepare pasta with zucchini and sausage, start by finely chopping up the shallot [1]. Wash and tip the zucchini, cut it into slices and then dice into cubes that are around 0.2 inches in size [2]. Wash the tomatoes and cut them into four pieces [3].
Now take the sausage, cut into the casing and delicately pull it off by hand [4]. Finely chop the sausage up with a knife [5] and keep separated. Place the oil and shallot in a pan [6].
Leave to brown for a few minutes, then add the garlic clove [7], the previously finely chopped rosemary [8] and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the sausage, stir [9] and cook for another 5-6 minutes approximately.
Add the white wine, simmer and reduce [10], add the zucchini [11] and the cherry tomatoes [12].
Add salt and pepper to taste, leave to cook for 10-15 minutes, stir occasionally [13]. In the meantime, cook the pasta in abundant water, salted to taste [14]. Once the condiment is cooked, remove the garlic [13],
drain the pasta al dente [16] and add it to the condiment. Stir to mix all the ingredients together [17] and serve your pasta with zucchini and sausage  [18].
