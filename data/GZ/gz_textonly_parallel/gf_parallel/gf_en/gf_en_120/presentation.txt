It is neither a first course of spaghetti nor a classic frittata (egg-based dish) to serve as a second course, it is a unique finger-licking dish, to be tasted strictly in slices: the spaghetti frittata! Just saying the name makes your mouth water: grandmothers, aunts and mothers keep the secret of the perfect spaghetti frittata to be served on the beach as a satisfying lunch or at home as a recycling dish so as not to waste any pasta left over from the night before. Our version includes the addition of scamorza cheese and smoked bacon, but some add only Parmesan cheese to the base of spaghetti with tomato sauce, as it is commonly done in Naples. We have tried so many versions that we can't tell which is our favorite, even the simplest version, the scammaro frittata!
