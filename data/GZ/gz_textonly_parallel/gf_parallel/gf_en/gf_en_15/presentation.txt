It's time for a snack, you don't know what dessert to enjoy? We know how you feel, there's always so much choice. On the one hand we have the old school of thought, which could never go without savory pleasures such as bread and salami, or a filled focaccia. On the other hand, others prefer something sweet, be it simple, like ricotta and sugar, or more complex, like grandma's custard cake, a ring cake or some American muffins. But one ingredient trumps all: chocolate. So we've decided to bake this yummy gluten-free chocolate cake. In this way, those who are gluten intolerant can also enjoy this delicacy worry-free, in all its sweetness. Its consistency is very similar to Moist chocolate cake, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Given the absence of flour, the cake tends to sink a little, so to make it truly beautiful and delicious, we decided to cover it entirely in a soft whipped ganache. You can't imagine just how good our yummy gluten-free chocolate cake really is, why not make it so you can tell us! Don't forget to comment if you liked it and to send your photos...unless of course it disappears before you have a chance to do so!
