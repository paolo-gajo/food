To prepare this yummy gluten-free chocolate cake start with the batter. Cut the butter into small pieces, place it in a small pan and melt it on a low flame [1]. In the meantime, finely chop up the dark chocolate [2], place it in a bowl and add it to the butter as soon as it dissolves [3].
Stir right away with a spatula so that the chocolate melts; leave to one side [4]. In the meantime, separate the eggs, at room temperature, in two capacious bowls [5], and start beating the whites with around half of the sugar (0.4 cups) [6]
using an electric whisk (or a planetary mixer) [7]. Once whipped and glossy (so a little less stiff), switch off the whisk [8] and now beat the yolks with the remaining sugar, adding a little at a time [9].
After around 3-4 minutes the mixture will become light colored and frothy; now switch off the whisk and add the warm chocolate [11]. Stir with a spatula [12]
to obtain a soft and homogeneous mixture [13], then add the egg whites too [14]. Delicately fold them in them with a spatula, from the bottom up [15].
Then do the same with the almond flour, it is best to use a fork to remove any lumps (16-17). Butter a 24 cm pan and sprinkle with potato starch, or line it with parchment paper [18].
Place the batter in the pan [19] and smooth the surface by rotating the cake pan a couple of times by hand [20]; lastly, bake in a static oven preheated to 360?F for 50 minutes on the middle shelf. Leave the cake to cool entirely before removing it from the pan and placing it face down on the serving plate, so that the upper surface is now below. Don't worry, the cake tends to sink in the middle, it is normal and happens because of the lack of flour [21].
In the meantime, quickly toast the almond shards in a pan and leave them to one side [22]. As soon as the dessert cools, make the whipped ganache. Heat the cream without bringing it to the boil [23], finely chop up the chocolate and place it in a bowl [24].
When the cream is nice and hot, pour it over the chocolate [25] and stir with a spatula [26] until all the ingredients blend together [27].
Place the container in a larger one with a little cold water and a few ice cubes [28]. Switch on the electric whisk [29] and beat to obtain a clear and frothy mixture with a soft consistency [30].
Switch off the whisk and coat the cake with the whipped ganache [31]: both on top and around the entire circumference [33].
Clean the plate [34] and garnish with the almond shards by sprinkling them onto the sides from above, along the entire circumference [35]. Now your delicious yummy gluten-free chocolate cake is ready: buon appetito [36]!
