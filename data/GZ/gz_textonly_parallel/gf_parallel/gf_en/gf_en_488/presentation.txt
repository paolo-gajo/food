Are you ready to envelop yourself in a swirl of sweetness and imagination straight from the United States? Chocolate bark is all this and much more! The name of this sweet refers to the irregular shaped fragments of chocolate, which resemble the bark of a tree. The rustic and messy shape is their distinguishing feature: there are no rules or models to follow, you can mix and match whatever ingredients you have in mind, even the strangest of combinations, when creating your chocolate bark. These morish sweets are especially popular during the holidays: they are so simple to prepare that just like sweets, chocolates or praline almonds, they make a fun gift idea, obviously customized to the tastes of whoever will receive them! Tempted but feeling a little overwhelmed? Perfect! Let instinct be your guide, and use chocolate much like a painter uses their canvass, to reproduce you abstract ideas of goodness: sweets, nuts, salt, candied fruit...they all work a treat when it comes to chocolate bark! We created three different versions, tempted to taste some?
