To prepare chocolate bark, start by tempering the chocolate with the seeding method, to make crunchy and shiny chocolate bars at home that will for longer without softening. You still need to start with already tempered chocolate bars [1]: to check, test the bar by checking for a snapping noise when you break off a piece. Start by finely chopping the chocolate with a knife [2], then place two third of the chopped chocolate in a bowl and melt in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring each time with a spatula [3]
until fully melted [4]. Now remove the chocolate from the microwave and add the remaining third of chopped chocolate [5]. Stir thoroughly with a spoon, until all the chocolate melts evenly [6]. Now you can start making chocolate bark!
