To make wild berry cheesecake, start by preparing the base for this dessert: melt the butter in a small saucepan on a very low flame, then remove from the heat and leave to cool. In the meantime, place the cookies in the mixer [1] and blend them into a fine powder [2]; place them in a bowl and add the melted butter after it has cooled slightly [3].
Stir with a spoon to amalgamate the mixture [4], then butter a 8 inch mold and line it with parchment paper, add the cookies and use a spoon to press it down [5], for a firm and smooth base [6]. Leave to firm for at least half an hour in the refrigerator, so that the base becomes solid.
Prepare the filling in the meantime: soak the isinglass in a large bowl with cold water [7] for around 10 minutes, until soft (it will make the cream firmer). Squeeze and filter the juice of the lemon [8]. Wash and pat the wild berries dry, place them in a large pan and add the lemon juice [9].
Now add the powdered sugar [10], stir and cook for around 5 minutes on a low flame; stir occasionally. Once the cooking time is up for the fruit, remove from the heat [11], drain the wild berries in a colander, leave them to cool and place a bowl under the colander to collect the juice [12]. You'll use the wild berries for the filling, and the juice for the topping.
Now heat the milk in a saucepan, drain and thoroughly wring out the gelatin before melting it in the heated milk [13]. Stir with a whisk until fully dissolved [14]. Leave to cool. In the meantime, sieve the ricotta in a colander and place it in a bowl [15]; if the ricotta is especially rich in whey, it is best to leave it to drain in the colander for 1-2 hours.
Now add the fresh spreadable cheese [16], the grated lemon peel and the powdered sugar [17]; stir with a spatula or a whisk to amalgamate the cream, add the milk (in which you melted the gelatin), which will have cooled to lukewarm by now [18]; stir until smooth.
Remove the mold from the refrigerator, the base will be nice and firm by now. Pour half of the creamy mixture over theÂ cookie base. Smooth the surface with a spatula [19] and then add the previously drained wild berries [20]. Cover the layer of fruit with the remaining cream [21],
smooth the surface with a spatula [22] and leave in the refrigerator to firm up for 2 hours. Once the cheesecake is nice and cold, prepare the topping: pour 10 oz of the wild berry juice you left to one side in a saucepan [23] and add the sieved cornstarch [24].  Stir with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming, place the saucepan on the stove and slowly thicken on a low flame for around 5 minutes, then leave to cool; stir frequently. 
Now remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator, pour the wild berry sauce over it [25] and smooth the surface with a spatula [26]. Place back in the refrigerator for the topping to firm up, for at least 1 hour. Once nice and firm, garnish with the wild berries. You wild berry cheesecake is ready to be enjoyed [27]!
