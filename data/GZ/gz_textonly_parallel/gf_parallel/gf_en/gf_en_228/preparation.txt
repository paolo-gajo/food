To prepare poached eggs, fill a large pan with water, leaving 4-5 cm from the edge. Turn on a moderate heat, then pour in the white wine vinegar [1] and coarse salt [2]. When the salt has dissolved and the water begins to boil slightly (it should not boil too hard), lower the heat and mix in the same direction with a spoon to create a whirl in the water [3].
Break an egg into a small bowl and pour it into the center of the vortex [4]. Let the egg cook for 2 minutes, without stirring or moving the egg: after 2 minutes you will get a liquid yolk, if you prefer you can slightly extend the cooking time. Gently drain the egg with the help of a slotted spoon and place it on a plate [5]. Your poached eggs are ready to be enjoyed while still hot [6]!
