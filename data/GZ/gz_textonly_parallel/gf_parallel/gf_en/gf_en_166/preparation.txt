To make roasted vegetables, start by washing and drying all the vegetables; peel the potatoes [1] and cut them into 0.8 inch (2 cm) pieces [2]. Tip the zucchini and cut them into small pieces of equal size, just like with the potatoes.
Do the same with the eggplants (4-5). Cut the peppers in half, remove the pith and seeds [6]
and cut into small, 0.8 inch (2 cm) pieces [7]. Tip the carrots and cut into 0.8 inch (2 cm) slices [8]. Peel and thickly slice the onion, then cut each slice into four pieces [9].
Finely chop the fresh parsley [10] and leave to one side. Grease a baking tray with the oil [11] and add all the vegetables [12] along with the garlic cloves.
Saute the ingredients and add a drizzle of olive oil [14], then stir to flavor.
Now place the breadcrumbs, grated cheese [16] and finely chopped parsley [17] in a bowl and stir with a spoon to mix the ingredients together [18].
Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the vegetables (19-20) and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 355째F (180째C) for 80 minutes. Set the oven to grill and bake for another 10 minutes at 390째F (200째C), so that a golden crust forms on the surface, Once baked, remove your roasted vegetables from the oven and leave them to cool slightly before serving [21].
