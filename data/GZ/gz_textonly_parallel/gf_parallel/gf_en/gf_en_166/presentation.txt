With their infinite palate of colors and tastes, vegetables enrich any dish: from the most morish of starters, like zucchini flowers in batter, to rich and hearty single dishes, like eggplant parmigiana. An unmissable pairing with meat and fish-based second courses, vegetables are also delicious prepared in the simplest of ways, just like in this recipe of ours: roasted vegetables. A bright and cheerful mix of diced summer vegetables, flavored with an aromatic breadcrumb coating that will develop an irresistible crust once baked. Simple and bursting with goodness, this appetizing side dish is perfect served with oven roasted fish fillets or oven roasted ribs!?
