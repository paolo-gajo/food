To make porcini mushroom risotto, first prepare the vegetable broth. Then clean the mushrooms: remove the base with a knife, scrape the stalk to remove any soil residue, then rub gently with a damp cloth. If some of the mushrooms have too much soil residue, pass them under a stream of running water, but be sure to dry them immediately to prevent them from absorbing water. Cut the mushrooms into slices approximately 1/4 inch (7-8 mm) thick, keeping the whole section intact where possible [3].
Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and briefly fry a clove of crushed garlic [4], then turn up the heat and add the mushrooms [5]. Sauté the mushrooms over high heat for approximately 10 minutes until they become brown, then add salt [6] and pepper and remove from the heat. The browned mushrooms will give the risotto a pleasant toasted note.
In the meantime, peel and finely chop the onion [7]. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the onion [8], and let it cook over low heat for 10-15 minutes, adding a ladle of broth if necessary. When the onion has softened, add the rice [9] and toast for a couple of minutes.
When the rice has become almost transparent, cook it by adding one ladle of broth at a time [10] and stirring frequently [11]; make sure that the bubbles from boiling remain constant and that the heat is not too high. When the rice is very al dente,, add the porcini mushrooms a few minutes before it is ready [12] and finish cooking, adjusting the salt and pepper if necessary.
Once cooked, stir the risotto over low heat, adding the butter [13] and grated Parmesan cheese [14], and mix well. If you prefer a less dry risotto, add another ladle of broth. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley, and your porcini mushroom risotto is ready to be served [15]!
