To prepare the Nutellotti, place 3/4 cup (180 g) of Nutella in a stand mixer bowl equipped with beaters [1] together with a whole egg [2]. Whip for 2 minutes [3]
to mix all of the ingredients well [4], then stop the whisk and add the flour through a sieve [5]. Mix everything with a spatula [6]
until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough [7]; shape and place in the fridge to rest for at least 15-20 minutes covered with transparent wrap [8]. After the necessary time has elapsed, remove the dough from the refrigerator [9]
and form balls of 0.5 oz (15 g) each with your hand [10], then place on a drip pan lined with a sheet of baking paper [11]: you will obtain approximately 25 balls. Use your fingers to flatten the center of each ball to create a cavity [12].
Once this has been completed [13], put the Nutella in a star-shaped pastry bag and fill the cookies, making a small tuft in the center of each one [14]. Once you've filled all the cookies [15],
top them with chopped hazelnuts [16]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 340°F (170° C) for about 10 minutes. When they are ready (the cookies will be quite soft) [17], let them cool on a baking rack. When cooled, serve and enjoy your Nutellotti [18]!
