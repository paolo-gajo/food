To prepare tomato passata, start by checking the tomatoes one by one, making sure they are not damaged, with spots. Wash them very well [1] and remove the stalks. Cut each tomato in half, lengthwise [2] and remove the central part with the seeds by squeezing them [3]. This operation serves to make the passata full-bodied, but if you prepare the passata in large quantity you can omit this step and keep the seeds.
Continue in this way by collecting the tomatoes in a bowl and the juice in another [4]. Read our tips for many ideas on how to reuse itthe pulp with seeds! Now place the tomatoes in a large pot [5] and let them dry over low heat for about 30 minutes, turning them from time to time [6].
When the tomatoes are well wilted [7], add salt [8]. Stir and wait a few more moments. Now pass mesh with a mill (place the setting between fine and medium) few tomatoes at a time [9].
Continue in this way [10], collecting the passata in a bowl [11]. Yout passata is ready [12], you can choose whether to keep it or use it immediately!
