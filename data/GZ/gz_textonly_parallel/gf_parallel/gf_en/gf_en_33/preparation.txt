To prepare vegetables au gratin, start by washing the vegetables. Tip the eggplant [1] and cut into 0.28-0.3 inch thick slices lengthwise [2]. Take the pepper, remove the top [8] and seeds inside.
Divide it into 3 large pieces [4], remove the white strings inside [5], then press down lightly to flatten. Tip the zucchini [6].
Cut into 0.2-0.24 inch thick pieces [7]. Line an oven tray with parchment paper and grease it [8]: in this way the vegetables on the bottom will be flavored too. Place them in the tray, it is not a problem if they are slightly overlapping [9].
Slice the vegetables with a knife [10] and season with salt and oil [11]. Bake in a static oven preheated to 356? for 30 minutes. Prepare the breadcrumb coating in the meantime. Place the grated cheese in a bowl and add the coarsely grated breadcrumbs [12].
Add the aromatic herbs [13], salt and pepper. Stir everything together [14]. Remove the vegetables from the oven 30 minutes later [15].
Add the breadcrumb coating [16] and a drizzle of oil [17]. Cook for another 10-12 minutes, once more at 356?, then move the tray to the top of the oven and switch to grill mode for a couple of minutes until nice and golden. Remove from the oven [18] and serve your vegetables au gratin.
