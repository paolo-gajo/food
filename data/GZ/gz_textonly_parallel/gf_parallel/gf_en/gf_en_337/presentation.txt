These mini mille-feuille are single-portion desserts that combine the flavor of the classic mille-feuille with a fascinating visual effect, alternating three layers of semi-caramelized puff pastry with two layers of delicate diplomat cream. The contrast between the crispy puff pastry and the melt-in-the-mouth texture of the cream makes this the sort of mouth-watering dessert you will never tire of. Mille-feuille is one of the most classic and delicious desserts in the Italian pastry repertoire, although itâ€™s actually of French origin.
