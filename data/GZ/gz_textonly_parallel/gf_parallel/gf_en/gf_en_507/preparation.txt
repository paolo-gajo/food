To make the cherry puff pastry swirl, first wash and pit the cherries using a cherry pitter (1-2) and collect the cherries in a bowl. Chop the chocolate coarsely [3], 
and then pack the chocolate into the holes where the cherries were pitted [4]. Set the cherries aside and roll out the puff pastry on a cutting board. Divide the sheet in half lengthwise [5] and brush the underside of both strips with melted butter [6].
Sprinkle the entire length of the buttered side with raw sugar (7-8), and then arrange the cherries in a row on top [9].
When you’ve finished, roll up the pastry sheet from the long side [10] to make a long roll [11], and do the same with the other pastry sheet [12].
 
Now take a 7-inch (18-cm) cake pan and cover the base only with parchment paper cut to size [13]. Now form a spiral [14] using one of the pastry rolls [15].
Arrange it in the center of the cake pan [16] and then wrap the other roll around it [17], sticking the connected ends together and sealing the final end. Now brush the surface with more melted butter [18].
Sprinkle raw sugar on top (19-20) and bake the dessert in a convection oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 30 minutes on the middle rack, until the pastry is golden brown. Once cooked, take the cherry puff pastry swirl [21] out of the oven and leave to cool before enjoying!
