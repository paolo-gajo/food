Succulent cherries, glowing like rubies, are only available for a fleeting part of every year, so itâ€™s worth snapping them up while you have the chance. You can use them to make delicious cherry compotes, cakes, fresh cheesecakes, or a cherry puff pastry spiral like the one described here. This delicious spiral of fragrant puff pastry enclosing an unusual filling of cherries packed with dark chocolate is the very definition of naughty but nice! As original and striking-looking as a fresh cherry tart, this fruity delight can be eaten as a sophisticated snack or served as a dessert to crown a springtime meal. Whenever you serve it, it will certainly vanish in the blink of an eye! If you love the combination of fruit and puff pastry, try peaches in pastry for a sweet summer dessert.
