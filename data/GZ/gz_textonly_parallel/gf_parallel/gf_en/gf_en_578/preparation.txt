To make the asparagus crepes, first prepare the crepe dough: break the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork [1], then pour in the milk [2] and mix everything well ( 3).
Sift the flour directly into the bowl [4] and mix vigorously with a whisk to incorporate it in the mixture and avoid the formation of lumps [5]. When you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous mixture, cover the bowl with plastic wrap [6] and put it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil a high pot full of water where you will cook the asparagus and move on to the preparation of the béchamel: pour the milk in a saucepan [7] and heat it, while melting the butter in a saucepan aside. When the butter is melted, add the flour in one go [8] and mix well to avoid the formation of lumps [9].
When you have obtained a golden roux, add a pinch of salt and grated nutmeg [10]. Pour the hot milk slowly while to mixing [11] until the béchamel has thickened [12]. Turn off the heat and set aside.
Take the crepe batter from the refrigerator and give it a stir. Grease a non-stick pan with a little butter and heat it well over medium-low heat, then pour a ladle of the mixture in the center of the pan [13] and spread it evenly over the entire surface with the special wooden tool or by rotating the pan. After about 1 minute the batter will begin to thicken and detach from the pan [14], then gently turn the crepe with a spatula and cook it for 1 minute on the other side as well [15]. As crepes are ready, stack them on a plate and set aside.
Now you can move on to the preparation of the asparagus: remove the white part of the stem and boil them for about 10-15 minutes (the cooking time can vary depending on the size), taking care to leave the tips out of the water so that they are steam cooked [16]. Once cooked, cut the asparagus stems into rings and keep the tips whole [17]. Melt the butter in a pan, add the asparagus stalks [18] and cook over high heat for about 5 minutes, then add salt and pepper.
Transfer the cooked stems to a mixer equipped with steel blades [19] and blend them to reduce them to a puree, then add 3/4 of béchamel [20] and blend again to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream [21].
Let's stuff and assemble the crepe: spread a spoonful of asparagus cream on the surface of each crepe [22], sprinkle with grated Gruyere cheese [23] and close the crepe by rolling it up on itself [24].
Take a large baking dish, grease it with butter and place the stuffed and rolled crepes [25]. After arranging all the cracks, sprinkle the surface with the leftover béchamel [26] and decorate with the asparagus tips kept aside [27].
Finally, add the grated Parmesan cheese [28] and black pepper [29]. Turn on the grill mode and bake everything for 5-10 minutes, until the béchamel begins to brown. Take your asparagus crepes out of the oven and serve them piping hot [30]!
