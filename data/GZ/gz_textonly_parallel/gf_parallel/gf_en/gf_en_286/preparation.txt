To prepare pantesca salad, start by washing and boiling the potatoes without peeling them, for around 30-35 minutes: place them in cold salted water [1], the cooking time varies according to the size of potatoes. Peel and thinly slice the onion [2]. Wash the tomatoes and cut them in half [3].
Place the onion, tomatoes [4], olives [5] and desalted capers in a large bowl [6].
Flavor with the hand-torn basil leaves [7] and dried oregano. The potatoes are ready now: drain, peel and leave them to cool before cutting them into pieces [8]. Add the potatoes to the rest of the ingredients [9].
Season with white wine vinegar [10], oil [11] and salt to taste. Stir to flavor and your pantesca salad is ready [12]!
