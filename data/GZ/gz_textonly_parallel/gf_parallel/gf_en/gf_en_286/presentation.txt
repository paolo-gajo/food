Pantesca salad is a traditional recipe of the island of Pantelleria: a wonderful land, rich in nature and gastronomic treasures. Colorful and fresh, this dish is a veritable triumph of Mediterranean flavors: nestled on a boiled potato and cherry tomato base you'll find sweet and crispy red onion, aromatic oregano, flavorsome olives and typical capers in salt, the pride and joy of this land. This amazing mix of ingredients is completed by a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, even better if Sicilian. Add a special touch to your summer lunches with pantesca salad and finish the menu off with another specialty this island has to offer: baci panteschi!
