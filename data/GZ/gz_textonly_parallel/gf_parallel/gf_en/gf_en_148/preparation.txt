To prepare scallops au gratin, start by making the breadcrumb coating: remove the crust from bread (which you can then use to make croûtons); dice the soft part into small pieces [1]. Place in a mixer, add the oil [2], salt and pepper to taste [3].
Add the aromatic herbs, parsley, marjoram, thyme (4-5) and lastly, the grated zest of a lemon [6].
Blend to obtain the breadcrumb coating [7]; with these amounts, your coating will remain perfectly moist, for a delicious dish that is never too dry. Take the scallops, place them on a baking tray and fill the shell with the breadcrumb mix you have just prepared [8]. Place the scallops in a fan-assisted oven preheated to 380°F (190°C) and bake for around 15 minutes, or until the coating turns invitingly crisp [9]. Your scallops au gratin are ready to be served!
