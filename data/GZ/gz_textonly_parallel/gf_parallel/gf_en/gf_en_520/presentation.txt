Each ingredient has a story that starts with its own characteristics. Leathery leaves, tender heart: in this recipe we tell you about the beauty of the artichoke with a traditional dish from Lazio, Carciofi alla romana (Roman-style artichokes). Nothing is left to chance in the preparation of this simple and fragrant side dish: from the choice of the variety of artichoke, the violet (or Romanesco artichoke), which is distinguished from the others by its rounder shape and its thornless leaves. Then the mint (or mentuccia better still), the clove of garlic to flavor the inside. And tightly squeezed into a pan, the magic happens: with a sweet and slow cooking this hard peeled flower is transformed into a delicious soft and fragrant side dish. Whether you are from Rome or not, serving Carciofi alla romana will always be a success! The origins of this dish are once again to be found in antiquity when, to feed themselves, farmers used what the land provided them, in this case artichokes.
