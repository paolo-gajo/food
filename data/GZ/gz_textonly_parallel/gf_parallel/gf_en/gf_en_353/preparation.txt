To make the mascarpone and chocolate chip tart, begin by preparing the shortcrust pastry using the sanding method: In a mixer fitted with the blade attachment, add the sifted flour, a pinch of salt, and the butter still cold from the fridge, chopped into pieces [1]. Pulse until you get a very grainy, sand-like mixture [2]. Pour the powdered sugar out onto a pastry board and make a well in the middle. Grate the orange peel into the middle, making sure you only get the zest and not the bitter white pith too [3].
Add the egg yolks [4] and then the pastry mixture you’ve prepared. Knead everything together quickly for as long as it takes to blend all of the ingredients [5]. Shape the pastry into a smooth, even rectangle, flatten slightly, and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the fridge to rest for at least half an hour to allow the pastry to firm up [6].
In the meantime, make the cream. Strain the ricotta into a bowl using a fine-mesh strainer and spatula [7]. Add the sugar and begin mixing using a hand mixer [8], then add the egg yolks [9] (save the whites to use later),
and the sifted potato starch [10]. Once the mixture is even, turn off the mixer and add the grated orange peel [11] together with the cinnamon [12].
Begin mixing again with the hand mixer to combine everything [13], and then add the mascarpone [14] and work until it’s completely absorbed into the cream [15].
Fold the chocolate chips into the cream using a spatula [16]. Set aside. Take the pastry dough out of the fridge and remove the plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin, hit the surface a little to soften it. Use the rolling pin to roll the dough out onto a lightly floured pastry board, to around ½ inch (1 cm) in thickness [17]. Arrange the dough in a cake pan (8 inches (21 cm) in diameter at the base and 10 inches (25 cm) in area) that has been buttered and floured beforehand [18]. 
Cut away the excess pastry using a knife and save for the final decoration. Level the edges of the tart using the prongs of a fork, making them even [19]. Pour the cream into the cake pan [20] and level the surface using a spatula [21].
Finally, it’s time to decorate the tart: Roll out the leftover pastry and, using a fluted pastry wheel, cut strips around ¾ inch (2 cm) long [22]. Arrange them on top of the tart [23], spaced evenly to form a rhombus pattern [24].
Brush the surface of the tart with the leftover egg whites [25], and then bake the tart for one hour in a conventional oven preheated to 320°F (160°C). Once baked, let the mascarpone and chocolate chip tart cool [26], then serve dusted with powdered sugar [27].
