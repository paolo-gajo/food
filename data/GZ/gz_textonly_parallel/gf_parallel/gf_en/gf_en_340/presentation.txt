These milk cocoa sandwiches are a delicious homemade snack consisting of two soft layers of cocoa cookie dough with tasty, velvety milk cream in the middle. Making milk cocoa sandwiches at home is a fun and easy activity you can even involve the children in. Who knows, they might even get a second helping for being such good apprentice pastry chefs! A soft, sweet treat to enjoy as an afternoon snack, ideal to bring along to a party, maybe along with one of our soft, fluffy cakes. Guaranteed to drive the little (and the not so little!) ones crazy!
