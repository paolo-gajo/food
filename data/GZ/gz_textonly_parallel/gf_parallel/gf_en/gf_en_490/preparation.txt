To make chimichurri, place the dried thyme [1], dried oregano [2] and crumbled peperoncino [3] in a bowl.
Add the powdered cumin [4], the black pepper [5] and the crushed garlic cloves [6].
Add the previously washed and dried parsley leaves [7], the salt, the vinegar [8] and the water [9].
Lastly, pour in the extravirgin olive oil [10] and stir thoroughly [11]. Leave to rest at room temperature for at least an hour before serving your chimichurri [12]!
