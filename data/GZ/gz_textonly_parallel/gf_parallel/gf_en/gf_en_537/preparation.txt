To make the breaded zucchini and scamorza patties, start by washing and trimming the zucchini. Grate them using a medium-hole grater [1] and then place in a strainer over a large bowl [2] so they lose their vegetable water. Now, grate the scamorza [3]. 
Press the zucchini lightly to squeeze out the water [4], then transfer the drained zucchini to a bowl. Add the grated scamorza and nutmeg [5] and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the breadcrumbs [6] 
and grated Grana Padano [7] to the mixture and knead with your hands [8] to combine all of the ingredients well [9].
Cut some parchment paper into squares of around 4¾ inches (12 cm) [10] and arrange on a tray. Take around 3.5 oz (100 g) of dough and place inside a 4-inch (10 cm) food ring mold on one of the parchment paper squares. Press the dough down with the back of a teaspoon to form a patty [11]. Gently remove the food ring mold [12].
Repeat to form 6 breaded zucchini and scamorza patties [13]. Leave the patties in the fridge for at least 1 hour. For the breading, dip the patties in a beaten egg [14]. Next, dredge them in the breadcrumbs [15], making sure the breadcrumbs stick well and evenly across the entire surface.
The patties are ready for cooking [16]: Heat a ¼-inch (5-mm) layer of oil in a pan and place the patties in carefully, one at a time [17]. Cook the patties over medium heat on both sides, turning them over just once [18] when they’ve turned crispy and golden.
Once cooked [19], drain the patties on a tray lined with paper towel [20]. Enjoy the breaded zucchini and scamorza patties piping hot [21]!
