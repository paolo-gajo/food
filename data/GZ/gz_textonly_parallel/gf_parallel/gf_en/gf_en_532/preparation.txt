To prepare the butter and egg-free chocolate cake, first start by finely chopping the chocolate [1]. Place the chocolate flakes in a bowl and set them aside. Now take a high-sided pan and pour in the water. Let it warm up over low heat. When the water starts to heat up, add the sugar [2] and, with a hand whisk, stir the sugar well to make it melt [3].
Once the sugar has melted, continue stirring and add the previously prepared chocolate flakes [4]. Keep stirring the ingredients vigorously with a hand whisk to prevent lumps from forming [5]. The heat will help dissolve the ingredients in the water. When the ingredients are fully blended and free of lumps, pour the mixture into a high-sided bowl or blender cup [6].
Use an hand blender and finely blend all the ingredients [7]. Let cool to room temperature. Then take a bowl and sift the flour [8] and yeast [9].
When the chocolate and sugar mixture has cooled, pour it into the bowl with the flour in three phases [10] mixing it vigorously with a hand whisk to avoid the formation of lumps and to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Drizzle the oil, [11] and once mixed, grate the orange rind [12].
Continue to mix the ingredients, then butter and line a 9 inch (22 cm) diameter cake pan with baking paper and pour in the mixture [13]. Bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 50 minutes [14]. Once baked, remove the cake [15] and let cool completely on a rack. You can dust it with powdered sugar before serving!
