To prepare beef stew, start by heating a saucepan with the meat stock and leave hot (you'll need around 4.4 - 5.5 lb but can prepare it in abundance and always freeze what you won't use). In the meantime, clean the celery, carrot and onion; finely chop the vegetables into 0.2-0.25 inch cubes [1]. Tie the thyme, sage and rosemary with a piece of cooking twine [2]. Lastly, cut the meat into 1.6 - 2 inch sized cubes [3].
Heat the butter and oil in a casserole [4]. As soon as the bottom is hot, add the finely chopped celery, carrot and onion and leave to flavor on a low flame for around ten minutes; you can add a little hot stock if necessary [5]. Once the vegetables have thoroughly sweated, add the meat [6],
turn up the flame and cook the contents thoroughly for ten minutes or so, add salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with flour and leave to toast for a couple of minutes: be very careful not to burn it, so stir frequently [7]. Add the red wine, simmer and reduce [8], then add the bouquet garni and cover with the hot beef stock [9].
Cover with a lid and leave to cook on a medium flame for at least 2 hours; be sure to stir occasionally and check to see whether more meat stock needs to be added, so that it doesn't become too dry [10]. Once cooked, remove the bouquet garni [11] and make sure the beef stew is salted to taste. Now all you need to do is serve your beef stew [12]!
