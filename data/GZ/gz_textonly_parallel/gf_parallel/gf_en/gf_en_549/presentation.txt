When considering Sunday lunch, there are so many traditional recipes that choosing an actual favorite is an impossible task. Some are indissolubly bound with lasagna or cannelloni while for others it's a tough choice between Neapolitan ragout and Bolognese sauce. However, there is no hesitation when it comes to second courses: beef stew emerges triumphant! Its slow cooking, coupled with few and essential aromas, are what make it so good: it is a recipe loved by everyone. Just like all recipes of the past it requires a lot of patience to make it well. So, all you'll have to do is place the casserole on the stove and forget about it: in the meantime you can turn your attention to preparing a few flavorsome side dishes like some morish and genuine roast vegetables. Enjoy the beef stew, for a truly special Sunday lunch.
