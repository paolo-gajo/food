To prepare the polenta chips, start with the polenta. Place a saucepan with water and oil [1] on the fire. As soon as it reaches a boil, pour the corn flour [2] while stirring rapidly [3].
As soon as it starts getting the right consistency, lower the heat and continue to cook, stirring with a wooden spoon [4], for about 30-40 minutes until the polenta has reached a fairly solid consistency [5]. Turn off the flame and grease a 15"x10" (38x25 cm) rectangular pan [6].
Pour the polenta still hot [7], and level the surface with a spatula trying to obtain a thickness of 1/2" (1 cm) [8]. Finally cover with parchment paper and level the surface with a rolling pin to make it smooth. Let it cool for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator [9].
Take the pan with the polenta and turn it over on a cutting board. With a smooth blade cut sticks about 1" (2 cm) wide [10]. Then cut in the other direction to create rows of sticks of about 3" (8 cm) long [11]: your chips are ready to be fried [12].
Place a pan with plenty of oil on the stove, and heat it until it reaches a temperature of 355°F (180°C) (use a kitchen thermometer to measure it). As soon as the oil reacheds the right temperature, dip a few pieces of polenta at a time [13] for about 8 minutes until they are golden brown. Drain with skimmer [14] and place on a tray lined with absorbent paper [15] to eliminate excess oil [15].
Finely chop the rosemary and mix it with coarse salt. Transfer the polenta chips in a basket lined with paper towels [16], and serve them with a sprinkle of the rosemary and salt mix. Enjoy the still hot and steaming polenta chips [18]!
