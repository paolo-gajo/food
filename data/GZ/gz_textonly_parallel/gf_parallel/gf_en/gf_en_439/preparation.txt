To prepare eggplant and sausage pasta, start by washing and tipping the egg plant [1]; cut in half, then into slices lengthwise [2], and then into dices that are around 0.4 inches each [3].
Arrange them on an oven tray lined with parchment paper and add a drizzle of oil [4], a pinch of salt, pepper and basil leaves [5], then stir [6].
Bake in a static oven preheated to 428 F for around 10 minutes; leave to one side once ready [7]. Peel and tip the carrots [8]. Now cut them into thin strips [9]
and then into very small cubes [10]. Now do the same with the celery [11] and lastly, thinly slice the leek [12]. Cleaning it is very simple: simply tip both ends, cut into it vertically and remove the two outermost layers.
Heat a saucepan with water for the pasta, and add a generous drizzle of oil to a pan, followed by the leek [13]. Add the celery [14] and the carrot [15].
Leave to brown for a few moments and stir frequently, before adding the coarsely chopped sausage, removed from the casing [16]. Stir occasionally while pan frying, and press it down with the back of a wood spoon, so that it crumbles into small pieces [17]. Cook for around 25-30 minutes. In the meantime, bring the water to the boil, add salt and then the spaghetti [18].
Towards the end of the cooking time, so when the sausage is thoroughly browned, flavor with the paprika [19], the hand-torn basil leaves [20] and lastly, the eggplant [21].
Add a ladle of pasta cooking water to dilute the sauce [22] and as soon as the spaghetti are firm to the bite, drain and add them to the pan straight away [23]. Briefly toss your eggplant and sausage pasta: now it is ready to be enjoyed [24]!
