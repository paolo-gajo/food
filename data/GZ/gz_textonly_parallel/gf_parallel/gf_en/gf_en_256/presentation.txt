Time for lunch and still don’t know what to make? Maybe you’re just not in the mood to go for the classic garlic, olive oil, and chili pasta, a carbonara, or pasta with tuna. No problem – we’ve got something that will get your mouth watering! Today we have a first-course dish that might seem boring at first glance, but really, it’s simply scrumptious. Pasta with smoked pancetta sauce! It’s ready in just 20 minutes and is a real treat for the taste buds. The rich, succulent sauce together with the aroma of the smoky notes from the pancetta make this pasta truly special. We’ve chosen sedanini rigati as the pasta shape since its little ridges will be able to hold the sauce better. You’ll soon see that this pasta with smoked pancetta sauce will win you over... right down to the last bite!
