To make the pasta with smoked pancetta sauce, start by cleaning and chopping the ingredients to be cooked: Finely chop the celery [1] and the onion [2]. Then chop the chili as well [3], removing the seeds to take away some of the heat.
Remove the rind on the smoked pancetta [4] and chop the pancetta into tiny pieces [5]. Finally, finely chop the peeled tomatoes [6] and then head over to the stove. Put a pot full of water on to boil to cook the pasta.
Heat a glug of oil in another pot, then brown the pancetta [7] with the onion, celery [8], and chili [9], over low heat.
Let them cook for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, so the vegetables soften and the pancetta browns [10]. Deglaze with the wine and allow the alcohol to evaporate completely [11], then add the peeled tomatoes [12].
Shred the basil by hand [13], add to the pot, and season with salt and pepper [14]. Cook the sauce for around 20 minutes or until it is dry enough or has reached the desired consistency. In the meantime, cook the sedanini rigati in salted boiling water [15].
As soon as the pasta is al dente, drain and pour it into the sauce [16]. Now, just add a pinch of pepper, a drop of oil [17], and a few basil leaves to your plates of pasta with smoked pancetta sauce. Buon appetito [18]!
