To prepare spaghetti Amatriciana (spaghetti with tomato and bacon), first boil the water to cook the pasta in, then add salt. Prepare the sauce: take the guanciale, remove the pork rind [1] and cut it into slices about 1/4-inch (1 cm) thick [2] then into strips about 1/8-inch (1/2 cm) wide [3].
 
Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, preferably a stainless steel skillet, add the whole chili pepper [4] and the guanciale cut into strips [5]; brown over low heat for 7-8 minutes until the fat has melted and the meat is crunchy; stir often to prevent it from burning. Once the fat has melted, pour in the white wine [6], turn up the heat and let it evaporate.
 
Transfer the guanciale to a plate [7] and set aside, pour the peeled tomatoes into the same pan, breaking them up with your hands directly into the cooking liquid [8], continue cooking the sauce for about 10 minutes. As soon as the water boils, pour in the spaghetti [9] and cook them al dente.
 
Add salt to taste, remove the chili pepper from the sauce [11], add the guanciale strips to the pan [12]  and stir to mix.
 
Once the spaghetti are cooked, drain them and add them directly to the sauce in the pan [13]. Sauté the pasta very quickly to mix it well with the sauce. If you like the pasta al dente you can turn off the heat otherwise pour a little of the pasta cooking water to continue cooking. To finish, sprinkle with grated pecorino cheese [14]: your spaghetti all'Amatriciana is ready to be served [15]!
