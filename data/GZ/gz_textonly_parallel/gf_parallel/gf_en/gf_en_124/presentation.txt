Regional dishes are often a source of dispute among Italians, whether they are professional chefs or amateur chefs, and spaghetti all'Amatriciana is no exception! Bucatini or spaghetti, bacon or guanciale, garlic or onion... these are the main questions that anyone preparing this recipe for the first time has to face. It is said that this famous dish, created in Amatrice, was the main meal of its shepherds, but originally it was made without tomatoes and was called "gricia"; tomatoes were added later when they were imported from the Americas and the sauce took on the name Amatriciana. It is therefore to be expected that such an ancient and popular recipe was transformed over time, taking on the many variations that are still discussed today. What we propose here is our version, prepared with local and op quality ingredients. We are convinced that the recipe for Spaghetti Amatriciana (spaghetti with tomato and bacon) does not divide Italy, but rather unites it in the name of the goodness of a dish with a simple soul and a strong character... just like those who created it!
