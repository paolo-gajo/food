To prepare focaccia, start by stirring the yeast and sugar together in a bowl [1]; add them to the bowl of a planetary mixer fitted with a leaf spatula, together with the flour [2]. Switch the planetary mixer on, then gradually add the milk and water previously mixed together [3].
Gradually add the oil too [4]. Continue to stir until the batter becomes firmer, then remove the leaf spatula [5] and replace it with a hook stirrer [6].
Add the salt [7] and knead for around 15 minutes [8], until the dough is firm and no longer breaks when stretched. The dough is moist so use a spatula to remove it from the hook [9].
Use a spatula to place it on a work top lightly sprinkled with flour [10] and fold it couple of time, so lift one edge up [11] and bring it to the middle [12]. Now lift another edge up and bring it to the middle and repeat once more.
Place the dough in a bowl [13] and cover with plastic wrap. Place the bowl inside a switched off oven with the lights on and leaven for 2 hours, or until it grows to twice its original size [14]. Grease a tray (we used a rectangular 14"x11" tray) by thoroughly brushing the entire surface and edges [15],
add the dough and grease your hands to prevent the dough from sticking [16]. Start spreading it out with your finger tips [17] to cover the entire surface and sides [18]. Given that the dough is very moist, if you are unable to cover the entire mold, leave it to rest for a few more minutes before trying to spread it once more. 
Cover with plastic wrap once finished [19] and leaven for another hour in a switched off oven with the lights on [20]. Once the time us up, grease the tips of your fingers with oil and form dimples in the dough [21].
Drizzle with oil [22] and sprinkle with a little rosemary and salt flakes [23]. Your focaccia is ready to be baked in a static oven set to 355°F (180°C) for around 35-40 minutes on the lowest shelf (check to see if it is done without opening the oven). Once baked [24], all you need to do is remove it and enjoy it, plain or filled!
