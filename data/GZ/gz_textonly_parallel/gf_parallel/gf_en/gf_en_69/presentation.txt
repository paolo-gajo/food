Tarte tatin is a classic apple dessert in the French tradition originally from the beginning of the century thanks to the inventiveness of sisters Carolina and Stephanie Tatin, hoteliers in Loret-Cher, France. It seems that this delicious tart arose from an error, like another famous French recipe: the ganache cream. Apparently, Stephanie, an expert cook, had to remedy her serious oversight: the room was full of patrons but she hadn't prepared her legendary apple pie that day. Without panicking, she ran into the kitchen, buttered and sprinkled sugar on a baking pan, put apples in it and baked it. But in her haste, she soon realized that she had forgotten the bottom bris√©e dough: so she covered the pan with just one layer of dough and put it all back in the oven. The story has a happy ending: after baking, Stephanie turned the tart over on a plate and took it to the dining room where it was literally devoured by those present. That is how tarte tatin was born. Today this magic is replicated in the kitchen of Giallozafferano thanks to the French chef of Italian origin Denny Imbroisi.
