Who among us has never tasted fried chicken at least once in their life, finding it irresistibly tasty? We, too, could not resist this temptation, and decided to provide a delicious variation, or rather 3! Our crispy chicken fingers will in fact be accompanied by three different types of mayonnaise without eggs that are superfast and delicious to customize to please every palate! Whether sweet and sour or spicy, this light version of mayonnaise will be the ideal accompaniment to dip these fragrant golden sticks in. Gather your friends for an informal finger-licking fried chicken dinner!
