To prepare boar ragu, coarsely chop the celery [1], carrot [2] and onion [3].
Cut the boar into slices and place in a bowl [4], then add the vegetables and bay leaves, then cover with the red wine [5]. Leave to marinade for at least 12 hours and no longer than 24 hours [6]. This will tame the strong gamey flavor.
Once the marinating time is up, cut the meat [7] into small pieces, each around 0.4 inches (1 cm) in size [8], then leave them to one side and chop the carrots [9].
Do the same with celery [10] and onion [11]. Place the vegetables in a pan with a drizzle of oil and the garlic cloves [12].
Add the juniper berries [13] and the aromatic herbs tied together with the cooking twine [14]. Sweat all the vegetables for about 20 minutes, and add the tomato paste [15].
Add some red wine, and simmer [16]. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add the previously chopped boar meat [17]. Cook over medium/high flame for a few minutes and add the hot vegetable broth [18].
Cook with the lid half covering the pan [19] over a very low heat, until the broth is reduced and the meat becomes tender. It usually takes around 1.5 hours. Add the grated dark chocolate [20] and season with salt [21].
Add pepper to taste [22] and the boar ragu is ready [23] to be enjoyed with some homemade pasta [24].
