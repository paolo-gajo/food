To prepare the arancini, start by boiling the rice in 5 cups (1.2 L) of salted boiling water [1] so that when it’s cooked, the water will be completely absorbed (this will ensure that all of the starch remains in the pan and you’ll get a very dry and compact rice). Cook for about 15 minutes, then dissolve the saffron in a drop of hot water and add it to the cooked rice [2]. Add the chopped butter as well [3].
Add the grated cheese [4], mix well to combine everything, then pour the rice onto a wide, shallow tray [5], spread evenly, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to cool completely (the wrap will keep the surface of the rice from drying out). Let the rice rest for a couple of hours at room temperature. In the meantime, prepare your ragu filling, starting by peeling and finely slicing the onion [6].
Sweat the chopped onion in a pan with 2 tablespoons of oil and the butter [7], then add the ground meat [8]. Brown over high heat, then add the wine [9] and allow the alcohol to evaporate.
At this point, add the tomato puree [10] and salt and pepper to taste, cover, and simmer on low heat for at least 20 minutes. Add the peas halfway through (11-12) (you can add just a little hot water if need be, because the ragu should be nicely thickened and not runny).
While the peas are cooking, cut the caciocavallo cheese [13], ham [14], and mozzarella [15] into cubes. Now all your fillings are ready.
Once the rice has cooled completely (this will take at least a couple of hours), you can start shaping your arancini balls. Keep a bowl of water close by so you can moisten your hands to help you during the process. Taking a couple of tablespoons of rice at a time (around 120 g of rice), press the mixture into the hollow of your palm to form a shell [16], spoon in a teaspoon of ragu filling [17], and add a few cubes of caciocavallo cheese [18].
Next, fill in the base of the arancino ball with the rice [19], and shape it into a point [20]. You can shape all of the arancini stuffed with ragu in this way. For the ham filling [21], meanwhile, fill each arancino ball (consisting of around ¾ cup (130 g) of rice) with diced ham and mozzarella. Arancini made with this type of filling are traditionally referred to as “al burro.”
Roll into balls [22]. Now that you have all of your arancini ready [23], you'll need to prepare the batter. Pour the sifted flour, a pinch of salt and the water into a bowl [24]. Mix thoroughly with a whisk to prevent any lumps from forming.
Next, dip the arancini into the batter [25] one at a time, ensuring that you cover them completely [26], and roll them in the breadcrumbs [27].
Heat the oil in a saucepan and bring it to a temperature of 340°F (170°C), at which point you can start frying your arancini, one at a time, two at most [28], so as not to lower the temperature of the oil. Once they are golden brown [29], drain them by placing them on a tray lined with paper towel [30]. These arancini are definitely best served nice and hot!
