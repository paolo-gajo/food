Arancini (or arancine) rice balls, the pride of Sicilian cuisine, can be eaten as a snack or served as an appetizer, first course, or even main course. You’ll find them everywhere in Sicily, at any time of day or year, always served hot and fragrant at the island’s many fried food shops, although their shape and size will often vary from town to town, from oval to pear-shaped or round, depending on the filling. There are around 100 variations on the arancino, from the most traditional, with ragu and ham, to the most original, like pistachio or spinach, and you’ll even find them baked! Our recipe focuses on two timeless classics, the first with pork ragu and peas and the second with ham and mozzarella. Which will be your favorite?
