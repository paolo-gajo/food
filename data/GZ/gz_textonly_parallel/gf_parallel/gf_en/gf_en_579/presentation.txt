Green is the color of spring, just like asparagus, which we have chosen for this deliciousÂ asparagus and pancetta pasta dish! A first course that is easy to make, yet oh so delicious. I'm sure you all know that no part of an asparagus goes to waste: some of the stalk can be thinly sliced, some of it can be pureed to make an enveloping sauce, whereas the tips can be browned together with the smoky pancetta. What can we say: color and goodness, genuineness and flavor for a pasta dish that will delight everyone's palates!
