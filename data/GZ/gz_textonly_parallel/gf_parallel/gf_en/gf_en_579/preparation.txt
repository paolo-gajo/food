To prepare asparagus and pancetta pasta, remove the tough ends of the asparagus stalks [1], cut the stalks into rings [2], cut the tips in half [3] and leave them to one side.
Peel and finely chop the shallot [4], cut the bacon into strips [5]. Bring the water for cooking the pasta to the boil, add salt and in the meantime, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan [6]. 
Add the finely chopped shallot [7] and leave to brown on medium heat for 2-3 minutes, stir occasionally. Add the asparagus stalk rings [8], add salt and pepper to taste. Add a ladle of hot water (taken from the pot in which the pasta will be cooked), simmer and reduce [9]. Cook for around 10 minutes and add a little hot water if necessary.
Once the asparagus is cooked, remove around 2/3 of it and place in a glass together with 2 tbsp of oil [10], 1/2 cups of water [11] and blend using an immersion blender [12].
You should now have a smooth cream [13]. Leave the cream to one side, add the bacon to the pan in which the asparagus was cooked [14] and leave to brown for 2 minutes on medium heat, stir occasionally. Now add the asparagus tips [15] and leave to brown for another 5 minutes.
In the meantime, cook the pasta until firm to the bite [16]. Save a few strips of pancetta and browned asparagus tips [17] and add the asparagus cream to the pan with the sauce [18], along with the asparagus stalk rings.
Add the cooked pasta to the pan [19] and stir for a couple of minutes until thoroughly coated and creamy [20]. Place the pasta on plates, add some freshly ground pepper to taste and decorate each plate with the asparagus tips and strips of pancetta you left to one side [21]!
