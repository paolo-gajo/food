Raise your hand if you love meatloaf! Classic or stuffed, with a scamorza cheese or spinach heart, this second course is always a guarantee for making everyone happy, at the table at least. This time however, we have chosen white meat instead of usual beef or veal, to create a delicious chicken meatloaf! Soft and succulent, like any self-respecting polpettone should be, it is very easy to make, even for less expert hands in the kitchen. Staunch traditionalists will pair it with essential roast potatoes, while innovators will perhaps opt for a delicious winter salad; but whatever the side dish, chicken meatloaf will remain the undisputed star of the table, worthy of a standing ovation!
