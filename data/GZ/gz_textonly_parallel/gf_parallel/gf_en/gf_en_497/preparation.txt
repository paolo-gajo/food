To prepare chicken meatloaf, start by dicing the cheese [1] and the mortadella [2]; place both in the mixer [3]
and blend together [4]. Remove from the mixer and place in a bowl together with the chicken mince [5], then add the thoroughly drained ricotta [6],
the grated Grana Padano cheese [7], the marjoram leaves [8], the salt [9], the pepper
and the egg [10]. Mix by hand to amalgamate the ingredients, add the breadcrumbs [11] and mix some more to obtain a homogeneous mixture [12].
Place the mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper and shape it by hand into a polpettone [13], then wrap it in the same sheet of parchment paper [14] and seal the wrap by folding the ends back down [15]. Leave in the refrigerator for at least an hour, so that it firms up.
Once this time is up, remove the parchment paper, heat the oil in a pan or capacious saucepan that is also suitable for oven baking (or you could move the polpettone onto a baking tray later on). Brown the polpettone on each side so that a nice crust forms, using two spatulas or kitchen tongues, so that it doesn't break (16-17-18).
Now cover the pan with a tin foil sheet [19] and bake in a static oven at 390°F (200°C) for 60 minutes. Once cooked (if you have a thermometer, check that the temperature inside reaches 160°F (70°C)), remove your chicken meatloaf from the oven [20], drizzle some of its baking sauce over it and serve [21].
