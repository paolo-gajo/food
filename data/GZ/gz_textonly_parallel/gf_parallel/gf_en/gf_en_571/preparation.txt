To prepare the baked eggplant, first wash and dry a large eggplant, then peel [1] and cut into ½-inch (1.5-cm) thick slices [2]. You should get around 10 slices. Now arrange the slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and score them with a small knife to create a grid pattern [3].
Oil and salt the eggplant slices (4-5), then pre-bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for approximately 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wash and dry the Datterino tomatoes, then cut them in half [6].
Cut the smoked scamorza [7] into fairly thin slices. Rinse the capers [8] and cut them in half, too. After 10 minutes, take the eggplant out of the oven [9].
and half a caper on each [13] slice of eggplant. Drizzle with a little oil [14] and season with salt and pepper [15].

Now bake in a conventional oven, again preheated to 390°F (200°C), for around 30 minutes [16]. Then take out of the oven, sprinkle on some dried oregano [17], and serve hot or warm for a tasty Mediterranean-style appetizer [18].
