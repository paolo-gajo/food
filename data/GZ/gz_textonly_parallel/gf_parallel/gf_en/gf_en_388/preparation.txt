To prepare grandma's ring cake, start by making sure that all the ingredients taken from the refrigerator are at room temperature, otherwise they will not bind together. Grate the lemon and orange peel and leave to one side [1], then cut the orange in half, squeeze out the juice [2] and filter it in a container. Now rinse the raisins and leave them to soak in the orange juice [3].
In the meantim filter the flour and the yeast in a bowl [4], then stir [5]. Before you continue, butter and flour a 9 inch diameter ring cake mold that is 3.5 inches tall and switch the oven on. Now that everything is ready, start with the preparation: place the softened butter in a bowl, add the citrus peel [6], 
the seeds of the vanilla bean [7] and beat with a whisk while gradually adding the sugar, a little at a time (8-9).
After around 5 minutes add the eggs one at a time [10] and continue to whisk all the while. Beat for a few more minutes until the mixture is frothy and homogeneous [11]. Lastly, gradually add the flour and the yeast a little at a time, using a spoon [12]. Continue to beat with the whisk all the while,
gradually add and temper the milk [13]. Switch off and remove the whisk. Drain the raisins [14] and sprinkle with a little flour [15].
Remove any excess flour and add the raisins to the candied orange peel [16]. Now pour 1/3 of the mix into the mold and spread half of the raisins and candied peel over it [17]. Repeat with 1/3 of the mix [18] and the remaining part of the raisins and peel.
Lastly, cover with the remaining 1/3 of the mix. Smooth the surface [19] and the cake is ready to be baked. Bake in a static oven preheated to 356°F (180°C) for around 60 minutes; check that it is done by performing the toothpick test. Once baked, leave the grandma's ring cake to fully cool [20] before removing from the mold and sprinkling with the powdered sugar to taste [21]!
