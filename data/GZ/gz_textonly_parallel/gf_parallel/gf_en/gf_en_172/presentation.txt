Risotto al telefono is a first-course dish that’s truly tasty, easy, and quick to prepare. It’s inspired by a typical dish from the cuisine of the Lazio region: supplì al telefono, fried breaded balls of rice and tomato sauce. What these two recipes have in common, besides the rice and tomato, is the cheese: As you pull the supplì apart, the melting cheese creates a string resembling a telephone cord, giving the dish its “al telefono” name. This recipe uses just a few simple ingredients to create a dish that will really win everyone over... a tomato risotto livened up with cubes of stringy mozzarella that will melt thanks to the heat from the rice. You won’t need to add butter or other fats to make this risotto rich; just measure out the broth well to get a creamy effect!
