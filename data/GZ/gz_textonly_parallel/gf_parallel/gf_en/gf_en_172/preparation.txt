To make the risotto al telefono, first prepare the vegetable broth and keep warm. Next, chop the shallot [1]. Drizzle some olive oil into a frying pan, add the shallot [2], and leave to soften. Add the rice to the pan and toast for a few minutes [3]. 
Then, add the tomato puree [4] and stir to combine [5]. Start to cook the risotto by adding broth [6]
until the rice is covered [7]. Add salt if necessary (taking into account how much salt is in the broth) [8] and bring to a simmer, adding more broth [8] as needed and stirring frequently. It will take around 18 minutes in total from when you began adding the broth to the rice. Cooking times may vary based on the kind of rice used; taste it frequently to see how it’s cooking. Next, cut the mozzarella into cubes [9] and set aside. 
As soon as the rice has finished cooking [10], remove from heat and add the mozzarella, a drizzle of oil [11], and the marjoram leaves [12]. 
Mix the risotto [13] until the cheese is nicely melted and the dish is creamy [14]. Serve and enjoy while still warm [15].
