This is a traditional recipe of Campania that is widespread and appreciated by everyone; despite its name, it is unknown in the Ligurian capital. This rich tomato-free ragu, prepared with lots of onions that turn into a delicious puree when cooked, is highly flavorsome and presents a sweet note. This is why the sauce needs to be balanced with the acidity of the wine and lastly, left to thicken, or 'dry'. Some save the meat and enjoy it as a second course, others prefer to use it all with the pasta, just like we have done!Â Lastly, the addition of grated cheese and pepper to the finished dish is also hotly debated... You will have noticed that genovese is a classic recipe loved by everyone, because you can choose the version best suited to your family's taste. We tried to collect the essence of tradition, but we would love to find out about your versions too! This Sunday, together with Neapolitans we share the gastronomic dilemma: genovese, Neapolitan soffritto or the classic Neapolitan ragu?
