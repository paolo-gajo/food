To make the scallopini with mushrooms, cut the top round veal into slices [1], then pound them with a meat tenderizer to make them thinner [2], flour the veal slices on both sides [3] and then shake them to remove the excess flour.
Now clean the mushrooms : using a sharp knife with a smooth blade begin by removing the earthy part on the stalk, scraping it gently until all traces of soil are removed [4]. If the mushroom is clean enough, remove the scant earth residue with a brush [5] or a cotton cloth, do not wash them with water to avoid ruining them. Slice the mushrooms [6] and set them aside.
Now start cooking the meat: in a pan melt half the butter (1.75 tbsp or 25 gr) adding the olive oil [7]; once melted, add the floured veal slices, salt and pepper [8] and brown them 3 minutes per side [9] or until the crust forms.
Once they are well browned, leave them to cool on a plate [10] and finish preparing the mushrooms: in the same pan you cooked the meat in, melt the other half of the butter, season with the whole clove of garlic and the chopped rosemary [11], add the sliced mushrooms [12] and saut√© over medium heat for two minutes, then salt and pepper to taste.
At this point, add the browned slices of veal and set aside [13] and flavor with thyme leaves [14], let it absorb the flavor over low heat for a minute, adding a ladle of water if necessary, and serve the scallopini with mushrooms hot [15]!
