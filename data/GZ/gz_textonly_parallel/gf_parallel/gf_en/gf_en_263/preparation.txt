To prepare pasta with butternut squash and speck, slice the butternut squash, remove the skin and then cut into irregular pieces [1]. Peel and thinly slice the leek [2]. Add a drizzle of oil to the saucepan and sweat the leek [3].
Add the butternut squash [4] and brown it. Add the water to cover the butternut squash [5] and cook on a medium flame, until the butternut squash becomes soft [6], which will take around 20 minutes; if it becomes too dry, add more water as needed. In the meantime, bring a saucepan filled with water to the boil and add salt.
Cook the pasta so that it is firm to the bite [7] and dice the speck in the meantime [8]. Add a drizzle of oil in a pan and then the speck [9].
Flavor with the sage leaves [10]. Brown the speck for a few minutes, until crispy [11]. Once ready, add the cooked butternut squash [12], be sure to save some for garnishing.
Add some cooking water to the sauce, just enough for it to take on a more fluid consistency [13]. In the meantime, drain the pasta and add it to a pan [14], followed by the fresh liquid milk [15], pepper to taste and salt, then stir briefly to amalgamate.
The pasta with butternut squash and speck is ready [16]: garnish the plates with the speck you saved [17] and serve nice and warm [18].
