Strawberry crumble is a delicate and delicious dessert, in which crunchy corn and almond flour crumbs envelop a soft, vanilla scented strawberry and cream filling. The outer casing is similar to that of the sbrisolona cake, a Mantuan specialty, but the creamy heart adds a soft surprise that will delight those of you with a sweet tooth! Perfect as a snack or a dessert at the end of a meal, you can prepare it in the spring with seasonal strawberries, which are sweeter and juicier. Making the crumble is fun, even for the youngest of helpers: strawberry crumble is a perfect dessert for preparing with your kids: they'll feel like budding pastry chefs and their snack will taste even better!
