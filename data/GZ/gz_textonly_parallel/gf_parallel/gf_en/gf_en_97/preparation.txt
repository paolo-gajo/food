To prepare strawberry crumble, start by washing the strawberries and coarsely dicing them [1]. Place them in a non-stick pan, add the sugar [2] and the grated peel of a lemon [3].
Saut? the strawberries for 5-6 minutes, frequently turning them over [4], then prepare the cream. Place the milk in a saucepan, together with the pulp and seeds of the vanilla bean [5]. Bring to the boil and remove the bean [6].
Place the egg yolks, the sugar [7] and the potato starch [8] in a bowl and stir. Temper the egg mixture with a little milk [9] and stir.
Add the milk and egg mixture to the saucepan [10], then cook to thicken it [11]. Place the cream in a bowl [12], cover with some plastic wrap and leave to cool.
Now make the crumble: place the flour 00 in a bowl, add the almond flour [13], the corn flour [14] and the sugar [15].
Dice the cold butter straight from the refrigerator and add it to the dry ingredients [16]; start to crumble between your finger tips [17], then add the whole egg and the egg yolk [18].
Continue to mix rapidly with your finger tips, so as not to heat the dough up too much [19]; once you achieve a homogeneous yet floury consistency, sprinkle just over half of the mixture into a 9 inch diameter cake mold lined with parchment paper; spread it over the bottom and along the edges using the back of a spoon [20]. Distribute the sauteed strawberries over the crumble base [21].
Now use a spoon to add the cooled cream you prepared earlier to the strawberries [22], and sprinkle with the remaining dough to cover the filling [23]. The strawberry crumble is ready to be baked [24] in a conventional oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 30 minutes (or in a convection oven preheated to 320°F (160°C) , for around 25 minutes).
Once baked, remove the cake from the oven [25], leave to cool, remove from the mold and place it on a serving dish. Sprinkle the strawberry crumble with the powdered sugar [26] and leave to cool before serving [27].
