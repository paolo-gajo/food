This vegetable originally hails from the Americas, but Italians have made it their own in a thousand different ways: Of course, weâ€™re talking about the pumpkin, that ultimate winter comfort food. One way to use this vegetable is to make pumpkin soup: A time-honored first course hailing from the province of Milan where three simple ingredients are transformed into velvety heaven. Pumpkin, whole milk, and short pasta make a winning combination that you can jazz up with all kinds of spices. Serve it piping hot during an evening with family or friends to magically melt the ice and make everyone happy!
