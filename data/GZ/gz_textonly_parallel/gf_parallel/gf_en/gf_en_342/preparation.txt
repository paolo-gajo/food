To make Milanese-style pumpkin soup, start by cleaning the pumpkin. Cut in half and then into wedges, then remove the seeds and inner strands [1] and cut off the skin [2]. Chop the pumpkin into slices ¾-1 inch (2-3 mm) [3] thick and place them in a pot.
Add the water [4], salt and pepper to taste [5], then stew the pumpkin for a few minutes with a lid on the pot [6].
Once cooked, transfer the pumpkin to a food processor and blend until smooth [7]. In another pot, bring the milk to a boil [8] and add the pumpkin [9], stirring thoroughly. 
Pour the pasta into the creamy pumpkin [10] and milk mixture and cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently to keep it from sticking to the bottom. Season with grated Grana Padano cheese [11], setting aside a little for sprinkling on top. Your Milanese-style pumpkin soup is ready [12].
