To make the battered zucchini flowers, start by preparing the batter. First, dissolve 1½ tbsp (15 g) of fresh brewer’s yeast, crumbled by hand, in a little room-temperature water taken from the 1 cup (220 g) of water you need for the batter [1], emulsifying with a whisk. Next, pour the flour into another bowl, add the rest of the room-temperature water [2], and mix with a whisk until you get a smooth mixture without any lumps [3].
Then add the brewer’s yeast dissolved in the water [4], continuing to whisk. Now add ¾ tsp (6 g) of salt [5] and ½ tbsp (6 g) of sugar, mixing again to combine the ingredients, and then cover with plastic wrap [6]. Leave to rest for around 30 minutes at room temperature.
In the meantime, clean the zucchini flowers, starting by gently pulling off the stems [7]. Then, still using your hands, pull off both the external pistils [8] and the internal bud [9]. Repeat these steps with all the zucchini flowers.
After 30 minutes, the classic batter will be well leavened [10], so now it’s time for the frying. Pour the oil into a pot and heat to a maximum temperature of 340°-350°F (170°-180°C) (use a food thermometer to check). When the oil is almost at the right temperature, put the flowers into the batter [11], using kitchen tweezers to turn them so they are completely coated [12].
Next, take each flower out of the batter [13], allowing the excess to drain off, and then immerse the flowers in the hot oil [14], only doing a few at a time so the temperature doesn’t go down too much. When the flowers are nice and golden, turn them [15] and cook on the other side, too. 
Then, take them out of the oil using a skimmer and place on a paper towel [16]. Season with a pinch of salt [17] and serve your battered zucchini flowers [18].
For a crispier version, once all of the flowers have been cleaned, as described above, you can make the tempura. Place the egg yolk in a bowl [19] and, beating it with a whisk, add ¾ cup (100g) of flour little by little [20], and then slowly pour in 1 cup (200 g) of ice-cold water [21].
Continue to beat until you get a smooth mixture [22]. Immerse the flowers in the batter, turning them so they are completely coated [23]. Heat the oil to a temperature of 340°-350°F (170°-180°C), as indicated above, and fry your battered zucchini flowers, turning them over halfway through [24].
Once they’re cooked, remove them from the oil using a skimmer [25] and transfer to a paper towel. Season with salt [26] and serve them still hot [27]!
