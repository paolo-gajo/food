When talking about Sunday lunch, the first thing that springs to mind is roast, often pork, or better still, pork loin! You will have guessed that today we are presenting a classic and timeless recipe: arista, or pork loin roast. Apparently the Italian name for this dish originates from the exclamation of a Greek cardinal, who after tasting it in Florence, exclaimed "Aristos", or "the best", and from that moment on, the Florentines referred to this cut of meat using the same word. Pork loin is ideal cooked in a pan, just like in the recipe with milk and oven roasted too, but you need to pay attention to a few and simple tips on how to keep the meat succulent! We invite you to discover all the secrets to preparing a succulent pork loin roast with Chef Cesare Battisti, who puts the fundamentals of his cuisine to practice in this dish: the importance of the ingredients and the clarity of flavors.
