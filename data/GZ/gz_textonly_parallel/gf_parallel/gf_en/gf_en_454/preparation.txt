To make cotechino with lentils, first soak the lentils in cold water for 2 hours [1]. Drain and rinse them under running water [2]. In the meantime, cook the cotechino following the instructions on the package, in our case it should be immersed in cold water and cooked for about 20 minutes from the time water starts boiling [3].
Now proceed with the vegetables: peel the carrots and mince them by cutting them first into strips and then into cubes [4]. Do the same with the celery [5], then peel and chop the onion [6].
Pour the olive oil [7] into a pan and heat it. Add the chopped vegetables [8] and sauté them for a couple of minutes. Then add the lentils, previously soaked in cold water [9],
Season with pepper [10], salt and add the rosemary sprigs and bay leaves with kitchen twine [11], facilitating the removal of the herbs after cooking. Cover the lentils with hot vegetable broth [12] and cook for 20 minutes or more depending on the desider consistency, adding more broth if necessary.
Once the lentils are cooked, remove the herbs [13] and keep the lentils warm [14]. In the meantime cook the cotechino, drain it and unwrap it [15].
Transfer it to a cutting board taking care not to burn your fingers. Peel it [16] and slice it [17]. Serve the plate of cotechino with the lentils hot [18].
