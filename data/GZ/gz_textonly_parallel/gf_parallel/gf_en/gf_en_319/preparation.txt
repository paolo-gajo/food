To prepare no-bake zuccotto, start by placing the cream cheese in a bowl [1]. Add the powdered sugar [2] and stir with a turner (or spatula) to obtain a smooth cream [3].Â 
Now divide the mixture: place around 1 cup of milk in a bowl, 1 cup in another and the remaining part (1 cup) in a third bowl [4]. Place the blackberries and raspberries in a mixer glass [5] and puree them [6].
Add the puree to the bowl with the most cream [7] and stir to obtain a uniform mixture [8]. Leave to one side and sieve the cocoa in one of the other bowls with the white milk [9];
stir to obtain a uniform mixture [10]. Whip the milk separately [11] and divide it into three equal parts, inside 3 bowls (around 1/3 cup each) [12].
Delicately mix with a spatula from the bottom up [13] and place the wild berry cream in a pastry bag without a nozzle [14] (you can also use a food grade freezer bag, simply tip one of the corners). Now you'll need a 6.5 inch diameter zuccotto mold (or you could use a glass bowl); line it with plastic wrap [15].
Now take the pastry bag with the wild berry cream and pour it in a spiral motion to cover the entire surface of the mold (16-17). Now even out the cream with the back of a spoon, so that it is even in thickness [18].
Now place the Novara cookies in the cream vertically, cut them if too long (19-20). Then take the white cream and add it; this time you won't need to cover the entire surface, but you should fill the mold half way [21].
Now add the cocoa cream too [22], to fill the mold to the top [23]. Add the last few cookies to cover the entire base [24].
Cover with plastic wrap [25] and leave to rest so that it can become firm. In the freezer two hours will be enough, otherwise you can store the zuccotto in the refrigerator for 12 hours or until completely firm. Once this time is up, remove the film from the base, place a plate over the mold [26] and turn it over [27].
Now slide the mold out from under it and delicately remove the film covering the zuccotto [28]. Decorate your no-bake zuccotto to taste, with wild berries [29] and mint leaves, before serving it [30]!
