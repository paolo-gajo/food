No one wants to switch the oven on in the summer and we're always looking for a dessert that is easy to make, even when on holiday, when we have far less of our utensils to hand! Today we're going to add to our collection of desserts perfect for the summer, which already includes cookieÂ ice cream cake and Oreo cake, with a very special recipe: the no-bake zuccotto. Unlike classic zuccotto, you won't need any kneaders or whisks to make this no-bake version: a special mold is all it takes, but you could even use a glass bowl in its place. Three different creams alternate to create a rich, articulated and well-balanced flavor...chocolate, wild berries and cream cheese, a dessert that is sweet to the right point, which you'll never grow tired of. You too can prepare no-bake zuccotto, bring it to the table whole and amaze your guests with the well-defined layers and the crunchiness of Novara cookies hidden inside, just waiting to be discovered, bite after bite!
