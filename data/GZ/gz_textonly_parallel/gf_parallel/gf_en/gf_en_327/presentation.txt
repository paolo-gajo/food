Out and about and feeling some hunger pangs? If you’re in Naples, you could stop by the first pizzeria or deli you find to order one of the frittatine di pasta, or Neapolitan pasta fritters, shown in the display case! Not familiar with them? Well, they’re not just little versions of a spaghetti frittata; rather, they’re fried medallions of pasta mixed with béchamel sauce and stuffed with a delicious ham and pea filling. You can chomp away on Neapolitan pasta fritters while exploring the alleys of Naples or waiting your turn outside of a pizzeria as an appetizer before tucking into a delicious pizza margherita! These fritters are a Neapolitan street food delicacy that’s truly hard to resist.

You’ll discover just how good they are and what a creamy filling awaits you.
