To prepare Spaghetti alla Nerano, start by placing the zucchini on the heat: wash and trim them [1], then thinly slice them into rounds using a mandolin [2]. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, once the oil reaches 150°C (300°F), the ideal frying temperature, immerse the zucchini slices [3] a few at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature, cook for about 5-6 minutes, enough time to make them golden brown.
Once cooked, drain them using a skimmer [4] and place them on a tray lined with paper towels to remove excess oil [5]. As you cook the zucchini, season them with salt [6]
and sprinkle hand-torn basil leaves over them [7]. Set the zucchini aside and bring a high-sided pot of salted water to a boil for cooking the spaghetti. Meanwhile, grate the Parmesan and Provolone del Monaco using a coarse grater [8]. Then, cook the pasta [9] until it is very "al dente" (around 6 minutes of cooking time).
Meanwhile, in a wide pan, heat 30g of extra virgin olive oil, add the whole garlic cloves to infuse the flavor [10], then remove the garlic cloves with kitchen tongs [11], and pour in the previously fried zucchini [12].
Add a ladleful of pasta cooking water [13] and quickly sauté the zucchini for a moment to soften them slightly and prevent them from becoming dry [14]. After approximately 6 minutes of cooking the spaghetti, drain them directly into the pan with the sauce [15], making sure to save the cooking water.
Add a ladle of pasta cooking water, as needed, to continue cooking the spaghetti, stirring them like risotto [16]: it will take about 3 minutes. Then turn off the heat. Pour in a portion of Provolone del Monaco, stirring the spaghetti to melt it and create a creamy sauce [17]; once it has been absorbed, proceed to sprinkle grated Parmigiano Reggiano [18] and the remaining Provolone.
Enhance the flavor further by adding hand-torn basil leaves [19] and pour in another ladle of pasta cooking water [20]. Stir well and once ready, sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Serve your piping hot Spaghetti alla Nerano [21]!
