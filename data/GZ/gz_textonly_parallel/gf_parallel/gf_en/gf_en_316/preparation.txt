To make Nutella crepes, begin by preparing the basic batter. Take a large, high-sided bowl and pour in the eggs [1]. Beat the eggs with a fork and add the milk [2]. Mix the ingredients well with a fork [3].
Sift the flour into the bowl [4] and stir vigorously with the whisk to avoid the formation of lumps [5]. Continue stirring until the mixture is homogeneous, smooth and lump-free [6].
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let cool in the fridge for at least 30 minutes [7]. After this time, mix the batter [8], butter a crepe pan or non-stick 8-inch (20 cm) pan and place over the heat with a dollop of butter. When it is hot, pour a ladle of batter to cover almost the entire surface of the pan [8]: you can use a crepe batter spreader to spread it evenly, or tilt and turn the pan slightly; this must be done quite fast, as the batter will tend to cook quickly. Cook over medium-low heat for about a minute on one side. As soon as it is slightly golden and you can lift the edges of the crepes with a spatula, flip it onto the other side [9].
Cook the other side for about 1 minute, waiting for it to turn a golden color [10]. When it is ready, put it on a serving dish or cutting board. Repeat this process until the batter is finished and 8 crepes with a diameter of approximately 8 inches (20 cm) are obtained; stack the crepes on top of each other when ready so they can be filled [11]. Then take a spoonful of Nutella and spread it on the surface of the crepes [12].
Fold the edge of the crepe over to the other side [13]. Fold the Nutella crepes in half so as to obtain a fan [14] and repeat for the remaining crepes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve your Nutella crepes hot [15]!
