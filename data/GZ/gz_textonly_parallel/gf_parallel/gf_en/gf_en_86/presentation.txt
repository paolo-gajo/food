The ever-popular pizza, adored by young and old alike, is a dish that’s never out of season and comes in countless different varieties. The recipe we’re sharing today is inspired by a typical rustic American pizza that pays homage to Italy: the Stromboli – a great way to enjoy all the goodness of pizza but in a different form! The whirlwind of flavor created by enveloping a tasty, stringy filling in pizza dough results in a mouth-watering roll similar to the traditional scaccia ragusana lasagne “bread.” Once cooked, the crispy shell contrasts with the soft filling of tomato, mozzarella, and ham, making this a very versatile dish that’s delicious eaten hot or cold, perfect for a picnic, a day out, or even an informal dinner with friends. Once out of the oven, simply leave it to cool for a few minutes before slicing it into mouth-watering pizza rolls that also make the perfect finger food! If you’re looking for a fancy alternative to the classic pizza Margherita, what are you waiting for? If it’s a tasty buffet you have in mind, you can’t go wrong with this stuffed pizza roll, and maybe even pizza tongues or pizza muffins to go with it!
