To prepare the orecchiette with broccoli and sausage, start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the broccoli into florets [1] and slice them in half, or even quarters if theyâ€™re too large. Place them in the boiling water [2] and put the lid on the pot [3]. Cook the vegetables for 6-7 minutes, and in the meantime, continue with the rest.
Finely chop the thyme and rosemary [4] and set aside. Make an incision in the sausage and remove the skin, pulling it away gently with your hands [5], then crumble the sausage meat using the prongs of a fork [6].
Drizzle some olive oil into a large frying pan [7] and fry the garlic clove, then add the sausage [8]. After a few seconds, add the chopped herbs and deglaze the pan with the white wine [9].
Using a slotted spoon, and without discarding the cooking water, remove the cooked broccoli [10] from the pot of water and add it to the meat a little at a time [11]. Leave everything to cook for 3-4 minutes, then use kitchen tongs [12] to remove the garlic,
and add a pinch of black pepper [13]. Bring the water you used to cook the broccoli back to a boil, pour in the pasta, and leave to cook [14]. Once the pasta is cooked, use a slotted spoon [15] to drain it and transfer directly to the broccoli and sausage sauce.
Add the last of the orecchiette pasta, along with a ladleful of the cooking water if needed [16], then stir well to mix the pasta into the sauce thoroughly, adding some black pepper and cooking everything in the pan for a couple of minutes [17]. Your orecchiette with broccoli and sausage is ready to be plated up and served [18].
