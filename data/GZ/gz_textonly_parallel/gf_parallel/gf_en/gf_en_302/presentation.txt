Orecchiette with broccoli and sausage is a really tasty first-course dish featuring two ingredients that often form a winning combination: broccoli and sausage, paired with orecchiette pasta here in what is a truly delicious recipe! This type of pasta is perfect for holding the rich sauce due to its texture and characteristic shell shape. To make your orecchiette pasta even tastier, it’s best to boil it in the same water you use to cook the broccoli, just like in the traditional Apulian recipe for orecchiette pasta with turnip greens. Don’t cook the broccoli florets for too long, so they keep their characteristic crunch. This delicious recipe for orecchiette with broccoli and sausage is also a great way for those who aren’t usually fans of broccoli to enjoy this vegetable and all the goodness it offers, so it definitely deserves a place in your recipe collection, alongside our pasta with sardines and broccoli, or the baked version with broccoli and pancetta!
