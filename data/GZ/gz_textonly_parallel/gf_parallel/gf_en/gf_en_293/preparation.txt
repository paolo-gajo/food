To make the paccheri pasta with salmon, first bring a pot filled with plenty of water to a boil to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, remove the skin from the salmon [1] and dice the flesh into ½–¾-inch (1-2 cm) cubes [2]. Chop the chives finely [3].
Once the water has reached a boil, add a pinch of salt and then the paccheri, which will need to cook for around 20 minutes or the time stated on the package [4]. While the pasta is cooking, lightly fry the garlic in some oil in a large pan, then add the salmon [5]. Season with salt and pepper [6] and fry over high heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring gently to keep the salmon cubes from breaking.
Pour in the white wine [7] and allow it to evaporate completely, then lower the heat and remove the garlic from the pan. Finally, add the olives [8], stir gently, and turn off the heat [9].
Now, place the robiola cheese in a bowl, add one ladleful of cooking water from the pasta [10] and stir until you get a creamy sauce [11]. Pour the robiola cream into the pan with the salmon [12] and stir gently to combine.
Once the paccheri is al dente, drain and add to the pan with the salmon [13], stirring over low heat just long enough to mix the pasta into the sauce [14], then turn off the heat and sprinkle over the chives [15].
For the finishing touch, add the grated lime zest [16], dress with a dash of oil [17], and then serve your paccheri pasta with salmon [18].
