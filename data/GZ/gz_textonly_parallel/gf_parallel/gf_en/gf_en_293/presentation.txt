Fresh salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fats, minerals, and vitamins... all great reasons to cook it more often! Today, we’re going to suggest using it to make a first-course dish that’s both simple and tasty: paccheri pasta with salmon. The robiola cheese adds a creamy touch to the sauce, while the lime zest gives it zing with its fresh, fragrant note and the olives take the flavor of this pasta dish up a notch. An ideal recipe for an everyday dinner, this paccheri pasta with salmon will please even the most demanding guests... maybe with the elegant addition of a velvety leek and potato puree, just right for special occasions.
