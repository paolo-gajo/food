To prepare tomino cheese in a puff pastry crust, lay out a slice of ham on a worktop, place a tomino cheese on one end [1] and wrap it in the slice of ham [2]. Repeat with the other 3 tomino cheeses. Now unroll the puff pastry and divide it into 4 strips, each 3 inches wide, measuring from the longer side of the rectangle [3].
Place the tomino cheese wrapped in the ham at the end of a puff pastry strip, season with a few thyme leaves [4] and a grating of pepper [5]. Roll the tomino cheese in the puff pastry [6].
Lastly, seal the edges by pressing down with your fingers [7]. Repeat for the other 3 tomino cheeses. Place the bundles on an oven tray lined with parchment paper, beat the yolk and cream together and brush over the resulting turnovers [8]. Cut 3 incisions into the surface of the puff pastry using a knife [9].
Lastly, season with few thyme leaves [10] and some ground pepper to taste. Bake the pasta in a static oven preheated to 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes on the middle shelf, or until the puff pastry becomes nice and golden [11]. Serve your tomino cheese bundles in a puff pastry crust immediately and enjoy them while they're still hot [12]!
