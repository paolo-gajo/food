To prepare the pasta pie, first boil the eggs: place them into a pot with cold water, and as soon as they come to a boil, let them cook for about 9 minutes.When they are cooked, remove the shells while they are still warm and set the eggs aside [1]. In the meantime, prepare the sauce: finely chop an onion and a clove of garlic [2] and place the chopped mixture in a large oiled pan. Let everything sweat for about fifteen minutes, adding a few tablespoons of water if necessary so as not to burn the sauce [3].
Add the tomato puree [4], season with salt and cook over low heat until the sauce has thickened: it will take about 30-35 minutes. Flavor hand-thorn basil leaves and thyme leaves [5]. Slice the eggs with a knife or egg cutter to obtain regular slices [6].
Now cut the salami, mortadella and provola [7] into small cubes. Also cut the mozzarella into cubes and put in a strainer so it will release the excess whey [8]. Boil plenty of water, add salt, and cook the rigatoni [9].
Drain the pasta halfway through cooking and immediately put it in the sauce [10], then add 2-3 cubes each of salami, mortadella [11] and provola [12].
Mix everything carefully [13] and transfer half of the mixture into a 13x9 inch (34x24 cm) baking dish [14]. Add a couple of tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese and half the boiled eggs [15].
Then add the remaining part of mortadella, salami [16] and provola [17]. Cover with the rest of the pasta [18]
and finish with mozzarella [19] and the remaining part of eggs and grated Parmesan cheese [20]. Your pasta is ready to bake in a static oven preheated to 390° F (200° C) for about 15 minutes, then 4-5 minutes under the grill to brown the surface. Enjoy your meal [21]!
