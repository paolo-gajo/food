We, for one, can only tell you the indisputable truth: finding cold cuts left in the refrigerator happens to us too. So empty the leftovers from the refrigerator and let's make rigatoni pie. It is a very simple first course that can be cooked mid-morning and be ready for lunch. Rigatoni dipped in a tasty tomato sauce, a handful of cold cuts and cheese cubes, then pop it in the oven. It is sophisticated and faster compared to classic baked pasta, to which we add meatballs and béchamel but if you prefer you could also think of adding and embellishing your pie the same way. Are you ready? Let's make it together!
