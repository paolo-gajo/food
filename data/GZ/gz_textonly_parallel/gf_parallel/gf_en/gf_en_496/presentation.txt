Does this sound familiar? You’ve bought some chicken breast and feel uninspired by the idea of just slicing and grilling it, but you don’t have much time for cooking, either. Never fear, we’ve got the perfect answer to the “what can I make for dinner tonight” conundrum! This tasty recipe is an ideal, surprising twist on the classic chicken breast dish: chicken strips alla sorrentina, inspired by the recipe for chicken alla pizzaiola (chicken with pizza sauce)! Our chef, who is 100% Neapolitan, is missing his walks along the gorgeous coastline of the Sorrento Peninsula, so he felt the need to make us a main course inspired by tradition… his own Sorrentine tradition of course! His solution was to transform the iconic gnocchi alla sorrentina dish into a mouthwatering main course. So, he replaced the traditional gnocchi that no one can ever resist with chicken strips, dousing them in a classic sorrentina sauce combined with diced mozzarella, all infused with a hearty helping of fresh basil! Feeling curious? Here’s the recipe for chicken strips alla sorrentina. As Giovanni says, it’s fast food, but not as we know it!
