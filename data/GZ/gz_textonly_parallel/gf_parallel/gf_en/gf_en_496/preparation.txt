To prepare the chicken strips alla sorrentina, begin with the sauce. Peel a shallot and chop it finely. Add to a pan with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil [1] and cook for a few minutes over low heat, stirring often to stop the shallot from burning. Add the tomato puree [2], salt to taste, and add a ladle of water [3].
Cover and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes [4].  Meanwhile, prepare the chicken. Cut the breast into strips about ½ inch (1 cm) thick [5] and then into irregular pieces about 2 inches (5 cm) long [6].
Coat the chicken strips in flour [7] and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [8]. Heat some oil in a frying pan and then sear the chicken [9] by cooking over high heat for 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally.
When the strips are golden brown [10], season with salt, and then add the tomato sauce [11]. Cook for another 2 minutes and then turn off the heat [12].
Add the diced mozzarella and the basil leaves [13], torn up by hand. Season with ground black pepper [14] and mix everything together. Pour into a casserole dish [15],
sprinkle the surface with grated Parmigiano cheese [16]. Broil in a preheated oven at (460°F) 240°C under the broiler for 8-10 minutes or however long it takes for the mozzarella to melt and form a lightly browned crust on the surface [17]. Your chicken strips alla sorrentina are ready to serve. All you have to do now is get them to the table piping hot [18].
