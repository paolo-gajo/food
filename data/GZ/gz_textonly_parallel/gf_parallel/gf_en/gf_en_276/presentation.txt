It’s always good to try the local specialties when you travel, and in the case of Italy, you only have to move from one city to another to discover unique ingredients and flavors typically found only in that particular part of the country. This is certainly true of the Campania region, where you could spend whole weeks and still not discover all of the region’s traditional dishes, but who hasn’t sampled the famous gnocchi dish from Sorrento, gnocchi alla sorrentina, at least once? The tasty sauce for this first course won us over at first bite: rich, juicy tomatoes; fragrant basil; melting mozzarella... so much so that we came up with our own delicious variation: pasta alla sorrentina. We opted to use fusilli pasta for its spiral shape that holds the sauce well. You’ll see exactly what we mean when you try it baked in the oven with a cheese topping! Pasta alla sorrentina is a spectacularly succulent vegetarian dish that’s great for sharing with the whole family.
