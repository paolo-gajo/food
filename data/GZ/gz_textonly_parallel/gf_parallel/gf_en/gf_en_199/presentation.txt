Fall has arrived, changing the landscape from bright green to orange, red to amber. Even the vegetable garden is a riot of vibrant colors, like the orange of the pumpkin. This delicious fall vegetable, which is particularly popular around Halloween, is especially known for its versatility in the kitchen, with recipes ranging from sweet treats like pumpkin pie to savory dishes such as baked pumpkin.Â Pumpkin gnocchi is, in fact, one of many possible variations on the traditional potato gnocchi, and these delicious little balls make a great fall first course with a delicate flavor. The dough is made from a few simple ingredients such as flour and pumpkin, and if you fancy a change from the classic butter and sage combination, you could always try serving your pumpkin gnocchi with a Taleggio sauce. What are you waiting for? Make the most of the season to enjoy the unmistakable taste of this wonderful vegetable and the soft, delicate yummy pearls.
