To prepare the apple strudel, start by making the dough: Pour the sifted flour and salt [1] into a bowl, then add the egg [2] and water [3] 
and begin to knead with your hands [4]. Then add the oil [5] and knead the mixture to form a smooth dough [6]. If it’s too sticky, you can add another 1¼-2½ tbsp (10-20 g) of flour at most.
Transfer the dough to a flat surface and knead until elastic [7]. When you’ve finished kneading, form a ball and transfer to a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap [8], and leave to rest for an hour in a cool place. In the meantime, soak the raisins in rum, or warm water if you prefer; melt 2 tbsp (30 g) of butter in a frying pan and toast the breadcrumbs [9] when it begins to sizzle.
Stir with a wooden spoon to keep the breadcrumbs from burning and brown for a few minutes [10], then turn off the heat and leave to cool. Next, peel the apples, remove the cores, cut them into four wedges, and then into thin slices. Add the apples to a large bowl with the sugar [11], pine nuts [12],
grated lemon peel [13], a pinch of cinnamon [14], and the raisins, which must be well drained and squeezed [15]: The ingredients must release their aromas but they must not be allowed to steep for too long, or else the sugar will make them release too much water.
Melt the remaining butter in a small saucepan over a low heat. Then take the dough ball and roll it out on a lightly floured dish towel [16] to form a rectangle measuring approximately 14x18 inches (35x45 cm) [17]. Brush the surface, except for the edges, with a little melted butter, and sprinkle with toasted breadcrumbs; this layer will absorb the juices that the apples release during cooking [18].
Place the apple mixture on top [19], then roll the strudel up from the longest side [20], taking care not to break the pastry (you can use the dish towel to help you). Seal the sides [21] of the strudel as well so that the contents do not come out during cooking.
Then place the strudel on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper with the sealed end at the bottom. Brush with melted butter (22-23) before placing in the oven. Cook the strudel in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for approximately 40 minutes (260°F (180°C) for 30 minutes if using a convection oven). Once cooked [24], sprinkle the strudel with powdered sugar and serve it warm, cut into slices.
