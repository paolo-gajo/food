Strudel is a dessert typical of Trentino-Alto Adige, but its origins are Turkish. The Turks, who ruled over Hungary in the 17th century, prepared a similar apple cake known as baklava. The Hungarians adapted this recipe to create the strudel we know today. It soon caught on in Austria, which ruled over certain areas of northern Italy at one time, and this is when the Italians were introduced to this delicious dessert. Trentino-Alto Adige is now home to the secrets of strudel making. The dessert has been very successful in the region due to the numerous local apple orchards. Apples are the main ingredient used to fill this succulent roll, along with raisins, pine nuts, and cinnamon. We suggest using Golden Delicious apples for this recipe, but the original recipe calls for Rennet apples. Prepare the apple strudel, enjoy it with a steaming cup of mulled wine, and revel in its intense aroma.
