To prepare the gelato bites, start by lining a pan with parchment paper, then place a rectangular cake ring measuring 7x10 inches (17.5x25 cm) and start pouring the ice cream [1]; spread it out with a spatula to cover the entire surface and create a thickness of about 0.5 inch (1 cm) [2]. Put the ice cream to harden in the freezer for at least 2 hours. Then take the ice cream out, and use a knife around the edges to detach the ice cream [3],
this way you will be able to remove the mold easily [4]. Make cubes of about 0.5 inch (1 cm), creating a grid with the blade of the knife (5-6). Place it back in the freezer for at least 3 hours.
After this time, crumble the corn flakes [7] and chop the dark chocolate [8]. Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie (be careful that the water in the bain-marie does not mix with the melting chocolate) or in the microwave [9]. Once melted, let it cool, stirring occasionally. In the meantime, place a tray lined with parchment paper in the freezer.
Pour the corn flakes in the melted chocolate [10] and mix [11]. After 3 hours in the freezer, take the ice cream cubes out and dip them in the melted chocolate one at a time [12].
Make sure you dip the ice cream cubes entirely. Remove the excess chocolate [13] and place the bites on the tray cooled and lined with parchment paper, and decorated with chopped hazelnuts, pistachios or coconut flakes [14]. Place your gelato bites back in the freezer and take them out when ready to enjoy them [15]!
