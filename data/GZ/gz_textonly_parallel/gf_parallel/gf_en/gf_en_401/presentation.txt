Small fresh and delicious gems, perfect for a mini summer snack: gelato bites. Dark chocolate outside and your favorite ice cream flavor inside (we opted for fior di latte!). A bite: a cool and sweet discovery that will make you finish the ice cream tub you just bought in no time! Perfect bon bons to enjoy an afternoon on the terrace or as a dessert to end an outdoor summer dinner. Coat your gelato bites with dark chocolate enriched with corn flakes, or simply decorate with pistachio, hazelnut or coconut flakes. However you decide to serve them, the gelato bites will melt even the coldest hearts!
