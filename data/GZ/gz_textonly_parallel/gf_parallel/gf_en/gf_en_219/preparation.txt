To prepare potato and ham pasta, start by making the meat broth, which you should keep hot. Peel and finely chop the shallot, then dice the ham and lastly, peel and dice the potatoes, too. Heat a large pan on the stove, add 5 tablespoons of oil and then the shallot; leave to brown for a few minutes [1]. Add the ham [2], saute for a few moments, add the white wine, simmer and reduce [3].
The alcohol will evaporate after around 5 minutes, add the potatoes [4] and salt and pepper [5]. Now add a few ladles of hot meat broth to tenderize the potatoes [6].
Flavor with the finely chopped sage [7] and add the pasta: cook as though it were a risotto, adding the hot broth a little at a time, to achieve the signature creaminess of this rice-like dish [8]. Once the potato and ham pasta is ready, make sure you have seasoned with salt and lastly, add a sprig of finely chopped parsley just before serving [9].
