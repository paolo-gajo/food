Is it possible to achieve a creamy first course without cream, soft cheeses, or other gimmicks? The answer is: potato and ham pasta! Unlike the classic pasta and potatoes or the flavorsome Neapolitan version, today we propose a recipe that is simple to make, but oh so rich and full of flavor! Thanks to the gradual addition of hot broth, the pasta and condiment will become one, bursting with an incredible and enveloping creaminess, just like a risotto! The meat broth is what makes this first course especially flavorsome; you can replace it with vegetable broth: the dish will be slightly less rich in flavor, but you'll still achieve a creamy and mouth watering dish!
