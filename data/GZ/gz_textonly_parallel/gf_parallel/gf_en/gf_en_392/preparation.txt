To make the Gorgonzola and walnut pasta, start by heating a saucepan with water to cook the pasta [1]. Once the water is boiling, add a little salt and the trofie pasta. Next, warm the cream in a saucepan over low heat [2]  and, meanwhile, prepare the Gorgonzola. Remove the rind [3],  
then cut into small cubes [4] and add to the pan with the cream [5]. Add a pinch of ground black pepper, some thyme leaves, and cook over low heat for another 2-3 minutes [6].
You’ll have just enough time to chop the walnut kernels with a knife on a chopping board [7]. At this point, the pasta should be al dente; transfer directly from the saucepan to the sauce [8] using a slotted spoon. Stir to combine everything together [9]
and to finish, add the chopped walnuts [10]. Stir once more [11] and then your Gorgonzola and walnut pasta is ready. Serve right away [12]!
