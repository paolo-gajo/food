To make your tagliatelle with eggplant, pesto, and cherry tomatoes, first prepare the garlic-free pesto using the instructions found in our practical guide. Wash and dry the eggplants, trim them [1], and cut them, first into slices and then into cubes [2]. Now prepare your cherry tomatoes by washing them, drying them, and slicing them in half [3].
Heat a little olive oil [4] in a pan, pour in the eggplant, and brown over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes [5], season with salt and pepper [6], and stir.
Make the sauce fragrant by adding the washed and dried basil leaves [7], and pour in around Â½ cup (120 g) of water [8]. Cook for around 10-15 minutes, or until the water has evaporated and the eggplant is cooked, then turn off the heat [9]. In the meantime, heat a pot of salted water for cooking the pasta.
Cook the tagliatelle until al dente [10]. Drain the pasta and pour directly into the sauce [11], diluting with a ladleful of the cooking water [12].
At this point, you can also add in the pesto [13] and toss the pasta to combine and develop the flavor [14]. This will take just a few minutes. Serve your tagliatelle with eggplant, pesto, and cherry tomatoes piping hot [15].
