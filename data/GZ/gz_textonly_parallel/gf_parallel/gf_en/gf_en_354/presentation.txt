Margherita cake is a key component of many pastry creations, one of the most classic and best-known desserts that we simply had to include in our recipe portfolio. A sweet treat with a very long history behind it, this type of sponge cake is part of the farming traditions of central and northern Italy; it was “the celebration cake” that evolved over the years in terms of both its composition and the method to prepare it, until it eventually became a real source of pride in the kitchens of even the finest master pâtissiers, who are always striving to achieve the perfect whip. This margherita cake recipe is based on a very simple and fragrant mixture of eggs, flour, and sugar, all enhanced with a touch of lemon zest that gives the cake an appealing aromatic touch and softens the flavor of the eggs, which really feature heavily in this recipe. The margherita sponge cake probably gets its name thanks to the intense yellow color of the dough and the generous sprinkling of powdered sugar that mean it resembles the colors of a daisy, or margherita in Italian. A very soft and delicate cake, it’s great plain, but also perfect for filling, too. Give our version a try and bring that extra touch of cheer to your children’s snack time, or even serve it as a sweet breakfast option – after all, it’s so good you’ll always find an excuse to treat yourself!
