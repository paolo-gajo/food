To prepare your margherita cake, melt the butter over very low heat and then leave to cool. Pour the eggs and sugar [1] into the bowl of a stand mixer. Turn the mixer on, using the whisk attachment on a medium speed. Add the salt [2] and grated lemon zest [3] before the eggs are fully whipped. 
Whip on a high speed for 8 minutes. Add the egg yolks one at a time [4]. Combine the flour, baking powder [5], and starch [6] in another bowl,
and sift the mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper, twice [7]. Reduce the speed of the mixer and add all of the dry ingredients at the same time [8]. Increase the speed to achieve an even consistency, then turn off the mixer. Take some of the dough, transfer it to a bowl [9], 
add the melted butter [10], and mix quickly using a spatula to create an emulsion [11]. Add a little more of the mixture to the bowl [12]
and mix until you achieve an even consistency [13]. Pour the mixture back into the bowl of the stand mixer and mix from the bottom up. As soon as you have achieved an even consistency, transfer it into a greased and floured 8-inch (20-cm) cake pan [14], possibly Teflon-coated. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 375°F (190°C) for 40 minutes. After this time, take the cake out of the oven [15] and leave to cool. 
Turn your margherita cake out onto a wire rack [16], garnish with powdered sugar [17], and serve [18].
