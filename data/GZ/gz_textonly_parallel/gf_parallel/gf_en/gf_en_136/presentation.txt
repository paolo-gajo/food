For today's recipe we decided to draw inspiration from 4 typical ingredients from Sicily, the beautiful Island of the Sun: swordfish, cherry tomatoes, olives and pine nuts: with these ingredients, we have prepared an irresistible Sicilian-style swordfish. A main course, typical of the pretty Mediterranean island, more precisely of the city of Messina where it is also known as Messina-style swordfish. The sauce, in dialect "ghiotta" or "agghiotta", is perfect to accompany the tastyÂ "piscispata" (swordfish), but it also lends itself well to enrich various types of fish and white meat, such as chicken or rabbit. We are sure you're very curious by now, so here is our version of the delicious Sicilian-style swordfish!
