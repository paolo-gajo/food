To prepare the Sicilian-style swordfish, start with the cherry tomatoes. Remove their stem, rinse and dry them, then cut them in half [1]. Pour the oil into a large frying pan and gently fry a peeled garlic clove [2]. After a couple of minutes, pour the cut tomatoes [3].
Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a little oregano, and cook for about 10 minutes [4]. In the meantime, cut the pitted olives into thin slices [5] and add them to the sauce [6].
Remove the garlic clove [7] and add the swordfish [8]. Let it cook for a couple of minutes on one side [9].
Turn the fish [10], cover with the lid and cook for another 2-3 minutes [11]. When the swordfish is ready, sprinkle everything with a pinch of black pepper [12].
While the swordfish is cooking, you can place the pine nuts into the pan and toast them for a few moments over a high flame, stirring frequently to make sure they don't burn [13]. When the swordfish is cooked, place it in a serving dish and top with the pine nuts [14]. Your Sicilian-style swordfish is ready. Serve it steaming and... enjoy your meal [15]!
