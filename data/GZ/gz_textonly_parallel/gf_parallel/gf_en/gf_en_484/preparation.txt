To prepare the chocolate tiramisu, start by melting the dark chocolate: chop it finely [1], then melt it using a double boiler, being careful not to let water come into contact with the chocolate [2] (alternatively, you can melt it in the microwave, stopping to stir every 2-3 minutes until it's fully melted). Stir to ensure it's completely melted [3] and once done, transfer it to a bowl and let it cool.
Meanwhile, separate the egg yolks from the egg whites [4] and add the sugar [5] to the yolks, then whisk with an electric mixer to create a frothy and light mixture [6]. You can use the remaining egg whites to prepare delicious meringues or ladyfingers.
Work the mascarpone cheese with beaters, then add it to the mixture of whipped eggs and sugar [7], mix again with the beaters to obtain a dense cream [8]. When the chocolate has cooled down, add it to the cream [9].
When the cream is ready [10], put it in the refrigerator while you continue with the preparation. Prepare the coffee with the moka and pour it into a low and wide bowl [11]; dissolve the sugar inside [12] (if you prefer, you can omit it) and let it cool down.
Split each ladyfinger in half and dip it in coffee on both sides [13], then place two halves at the base of the glass [14] and pour in the chocolate mascarpone cream [15]; you can also use a disposable pastry bag to create layers of cream. Continue by dusting with unsweetened cocoa powder, then add another layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and cream.
Once ready [16], you can dust with some unsweetened cocoa powder [17] and serve your chocolate tiramisu [18]!
