To make your tiramisu, prepare the coffee using a moka pot to get 1 1/4 cups (300 g), then add sugar to taste (we added a teaspoonful) and leave it to cool in a large, shallow bowl. Separate the eggs, being careful to keep the whites totally free of yolk [1] so that they will whip well. Beat the yolks with a hand mixer, adding half of the sugar [2]. As soon as the mixture has turned light and foamy, and while the mixer is still running, add the mascarpone a little at a time [3].
Once all the mascarpone has been added, you’ll have a dense, compact cream [4]; set this aside. Clean the mixer well and move on to whipping the egg whites [5]. Once they’re foamy, pour in the remaining sugar a little at a time [6].
Whip the whites to stiff peaks [7]; you’ll know they’re ready when you can turn the bowl upside down without the mixture moving. Take a spoonful of the whites and add it to the bowl with the mascarpone cream [8], then stir vigorously with a spatula to dilute the mixture. Next, add the rest of the egg whites little by little, folding them in by mixing very gently from the bottom upwards [9]. 
The mascarpone cream is ready [10]. Spread a heaping spoonful on the bottom of a glass baking dish measuring 9x13 inches (20x30 cm), ensuring the entire base is covered [11]. Now dip the ladyfingers into the cold coffee for a few seconds, first on one side and then on the other [12]. 
Then arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers in the dish [13], trying to position them all in one direction, to form a first layer of cookies [14]. Add another layer of mascarpone cream and level it so the cookies are covered completely [15]. 
Continue to add the coffee-soaked ladyfingers [16] and cream [17] in alternating layers, always leveling the surface of the cream [18]. 
Finally, transfer the remaining cream to a pastry bag with a ½-inch (12-mm) plain tip and cover the entire surface of the tiramisu with dabs of cream [19]. Sprinkle over the unsweetened cocoa powder [20] and leave the tiramisu to set in the fridge for a couple of hours. Your tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed [21]!
