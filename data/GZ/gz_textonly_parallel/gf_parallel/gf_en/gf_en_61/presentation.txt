Tiramisu is one of the cornerstones of Italian cuisine, one of the best-loved and most frequently made desserts in the entire world. The origins of tiramisu aren’t entirely clear and more than one city claims to be its birthplace. What we do know for sure, however, is that since 1980, when its name entered into the Italian vocabulary, tiramisu has been a huge hit! Nowadays, it’s one of the most well-known Italian words abroad. But what makes tiramisu so special? We definitely love the fact that it’s so easy to make, with an irresistibly tasty, velvety mascarpone cream layered with ladyfingers soaked in coffee. Some people like to flavor the glaze with Marsala wine, while others prefer to use different liqueurs, but we love it just the way it is, in the purest form, so today we’re bringing you the classic version that’s perfect for any occasion! Although we still haven’t found out exactly who invented the present-day version of tiramisu – some say it’s Ado Campeol, the owner of the famous and history-filled bar Il Becchiere in Treviso – that won’t stop us from sharing our recipe for one of the best tiramisus you’ll ever try! Make it yourself and let us know what you think.
