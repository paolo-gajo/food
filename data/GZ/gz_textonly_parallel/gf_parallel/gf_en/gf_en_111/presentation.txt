It was a quiet day at work when a magnificent tray of spinach pasta bake appeared on the table in the office! The first, timid tastings of this oven baked first course soon became abundant portions and soon, nothing but a few portions were left at the bottom of the tray. We tried hard to find an adjective to describe the sensation of contentment this generous meal stirred within us, and in the end we opted for nothing other than soul-soothing. Bring a little comfort to your friends or family with a substantial and nourishing recipe no one can resist: the spinach turns into an enveloping cream even children will love, and the gorgonzola adds an extra special touch of flavor that will win adults over too. Lastly, the crisp au gratin surface that will form in the oven will make you sigh with contentment once you have finished! Spinach pasta bake... and you, how would you describe it?
