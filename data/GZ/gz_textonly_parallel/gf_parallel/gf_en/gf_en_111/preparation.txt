To prepare spinach pasta bake, start by bringing a potful of salted water to the boil, which you will use to cook the pasta. Rinse the spinach under running water [1], dry it, place it in another pan, cover with a lid [2] and cook on a low flame, without adding any fat, until they wilt: this will take around 5 minutes. In the meantime, remove the crust from the gorgonzola and dice the cheese [3];
place it in a tray and start melting it on a very low flame [4]. Add the mascarpone [5] and whisk to stir thoroughly with the gorgonzola; once both melt, add the fresh cream [6] and continue stirring to obtain a smooth and rather liquid cream.
Now add around half of the grated Parmigiano Reggiano [7] and continue stirring to incorporate it, so that a smooth and uniform liquid [8] forms, then remove from the heat. Once the spinach has wilted [9], 
place it in a tall and narrow container, add salt, a ladle of the boiling water you will use to cook the pasta [10] and blend with an immersion blender [11] to obtain a cream; place it in a bowl [12].
When the water comes to the boil, add the rigatoni [13] and cook for around 5 minutes (calculate 5 minutes less compared to the cooking time on the packet, as they will finish cooking in the oven). In the meantime preheat the static oven to 350°F (180°C). Now drain the pasta and add it directly to the pan with the cheese sauce, remove from the heat [14], stir to thoroughly coat the pasta in the condiment [15],
then add the thyme leaves [16]. Now you are ready to assemble the pasta bake: take a square 8.6" tray and start by adding a first layer of rigatoni [17], a grating of black pepper, then cover the surface with the spinach cream [18]
and sprinkle with a generous spoonful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano [19]. Repeat in the same order until you run out of ingredients: add more pasta [20], followed by pepper and spinach cream [21]
and Parmigiano Reggiano [22]. End with a final layer of pasta [23] and cover with the remaining Parmigiano Reggiano [24].
Lastly, add a final pinch of pepper [25] and a drizzle of olive oil [26]. Bake the pasta in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C). for around 30 minutes, or until the surface becomes nice and golden [27]. Your spinach pasta bake is ready to serve!
