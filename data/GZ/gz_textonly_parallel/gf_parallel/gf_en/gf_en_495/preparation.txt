To make the chickpea and pumpkin soup, first peel the onion and slice it thinly [1]. Next, take your pumpkin, cut it in half, then remove the seeds from inside [2], along with the skin [3]; youâ€™ll need to end up with 1 lb (430 g) of clean pumpkin.
Cut the flesh, first into slices [4] and then into cubes [5]. Wash the chard and cut into thin strips [6].
Pour the olive oil into a pan, then add the sliced onion and the juniper berries [7]. Allow to brown over low heat until the onion has softened. At this point, add the pumpkin [8], brown over medium heat, and add with a little of the water [9].
Add the chickpeas [10], chard strips [11], salt, pepper and the rest of the water needed for cooking [12].
Season with the bay leaves [13], mix everything together, cover with a lid [14], and cook on high heat for 15 minutes. Once the 15 minutes are up, remove the lid and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes. Remove the bay leaves [15]
and juniper berries [16] and serve your soup with a drizzle of uncooked oil [17] and a twist of black pepper. Your pumpkin and chickpea soup is ready to serve [18].
