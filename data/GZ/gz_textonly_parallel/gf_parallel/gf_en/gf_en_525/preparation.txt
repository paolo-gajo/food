To make the cannelloni, start with the filling. Clean and finely chop the celery, carrot, and onion [1]. Then removing the casing from the sausage and chop the meat using a knife [2]. Now move to the stove. Add a drizzle of oil to a warm pot, then add the sausage and let it brown well [3]. 
When it’s nice and golden, pour in the chopped vegetables and stir [4], then let them sweat for 5-6 minutes. Next, add the ground beef [5], stir, and turn up the heat. Let the beef brown slowly. Deglaze with the red wine [6] and stir again. 
As soon as the alcohol has evaporated, add the tomato purée [7]. Stir to combine everything and rinse the pot with a little water to remove any remaining stuck-on pieces, then season with salt. Cover the pot with a vented lid and leave to cook for an hour [8], checking on it every once in a while. Meanwhile, make the egg pasta. Pour the flour into a bowl, beat the egg lightly [9], and then add to the bowl as well.
Work the mixture with your hands to combine all the ingredients [10]. Next, transfer to a pastry board [11] and work it some more until you get a smooth and even, firm and elastic dough [12]. Shape this dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and leave it to rest for around one hour in a cool, dry place so that it develops the right elasticity.
Now make the béchamel sauce. First, heat the milk, seasoned with the grated nutmeg and salt [13]. Add the butter to another pot and let it melt completely [14]. Sift the flour and, once the butter has melted, add this flour to the butter and stir vigorously [15]. 
After a couple of minutes, you’ll get a hazelnut-colored roux. Remove the pot from the heat for a moment and pour in the hot milk [16]. Keep stirring until the béchamel is thick but still fluid [17], around 4-5 minutes. Transfer the béchamel to a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap [18]. Once cool, if the sauce is too dense, you can dilute it with a little milk. 
Take your egg pasta dough [19] that’s been rested and developed the right elasticity, and divide it in two. Put each half through a dough sheeter [20], starting with the thicker side and finishing with the thinner one. You need to get a sheet about the thickness of a nickel coin (2 mm). If you don’t have a dough sheeter, you can roll out the dough by hand using a lightly floured rolling pin. Cut the sheets of dough into rectangles measuring 4x5.5 inches (10x14 cm) [21].
Next, blanch your pasta rectangles one at a time in boiling, slightly salted water [22], for about 1 minute each. Drain and transfer to a tray covered with a clean kitchen cloth. Be sure to lay the pasta out perfectly, without the rectangles overlapping each other [23]. If you’d like, you can also run them under cold water to stop the cooking process. In the meantime, the ragu will be ready and will have cooled [24]. Set 1/2 lb (250 g) aside.
Add the grated cheese [25] to the remaining ragu and season with pepper [26]. Stir and place in the fridge [27].
Take one pasta rectangle and fill it with ragu just in the bottom half [28], leaving about an inch of space from the top edge. Then roll the pasta up onto itself [29]. Seal the pasta to make a cylinder [30].
Spread a couple of spoonfuls of béchamel on the bottom of a 9x13-inch (20x30-cm) baking dish [31]. Arrange your cannelloni in the dish. Cover with the remaining béchamel and ragu that you set aside, and 2 tbsp of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [32]. Bake your cannelloni in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 15 minutes on the middle rack, and then for 5 minutes at 465°F (240°C) on the highest rack and in broiler mode, until a golden crust forms on top. Now you just have to serve your cannelloni while they’re still hot [33]!
