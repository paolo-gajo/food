Foil-baked sea bream is a healthy and tasty main course that enhances the delicate taste of this type of seafood. Foil baking not only preserves the nutrients but also reduces the fat content and adds flavor lightly; we have chosen aromatic herbs such as thyme and parsley, lemon and garlic to make this simple dish special. Once cleaned, preparing the sea bream will be a piece of cake. Bring the whole sea bream to the table in the foil wrap and fillet it at the table, so it will release all its aromas and flavors.
