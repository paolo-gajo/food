To prepare hot chocolate, start by finely chopping the dark chocolate [1]. Now place it in a double boiler [2] and leave it to dissolve on a medium flame, stirring all the while [3].
Leave it to one side and continue with the preparation of this recipe. Take a small pan, add the milk [4] and then sieve and stir in the corn starch [5], followed by the dark cocoa powder [6].
Place on the stove and heat it up, whisking all the while [7]; now add the sugar [8] and continue stirring, once more bringing the mixture to the boil [9].
Now add the melted chocolate [10], stir until you obtain your desired consistency and pour immediately into mugs [11]. Now all you need to do is enjoy it [12].
