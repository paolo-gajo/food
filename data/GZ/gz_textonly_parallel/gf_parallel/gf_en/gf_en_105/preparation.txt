To prepare squid ink linguine, bring the water you'll need for cooking the pasta to the boil and add salt. Now clean each squid. Start by making a small and shallow cut on the back, to remove the bone [1]. Open the squid in half and delicately remove the sack containing the black squid ink [2] and leave to one side in a bowl, covered with a damp cloth [3] so that it does not dry out. Repeat with all the other squid.
Remove the head from the body, skin it [4], cut away the eyes and the middle tooth; leave the part with the tentacles to one side. Before cleaning the last squid, heat a deep saucepan filled with salted water, which you'll need for cooking the pasta. Rinse all the cleaned squid under running water [5], cut it into strips [6]
and leave the part with the tentacles whole [7]. As soon as you bring the water for the pasta to the boil, add the salt and pasta [8]; cook for around 8 minutes, or for as long as it says on the packet. Heat the olive oil in a large pan with a peeled garlic clove; remove the clove as soon as it becomes golden [9]
and add the squid [10]; stir and sautee for 5 minutes, add the white wine [11], simmer and reduce for a couple of minutes. Add a pinch of salt, then place the ink sacks in the pan [12]
and press down on each one with the back of a spoon to break them open [13]. Stir to flavor the squid [14]. In the meantime the pasta will have finished cooking; drain and add it to the pan with the squid [15].
Flavor with the fresh finely chopped parsley [16], stir one last time [17] and serve your linguine pasta with black squid ink right away [18].
