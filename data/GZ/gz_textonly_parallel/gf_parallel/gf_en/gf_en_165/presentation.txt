Good Italian cuisine boasts many traditional dishes that are recognized and appreciated indiscriminately from north to south; as often happens, versions differ depending on the region. Roman-style tripe is a very appropriate example, as it is typical of Lazio, which contrasts with other already well-known versions, such as Florentine tripe, Neapolitan tripe, Bolognese tripe, and the famous Milanese tripe (busecca). As for many other traditional recipes from Lazio, Roman-style tripe has rich flavors and intense aromas, such as that of guanciale and mint, which is then enhanced with abundant grated pecorino romano cheese.
