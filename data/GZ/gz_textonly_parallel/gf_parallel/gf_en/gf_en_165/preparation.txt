To prepare the Roman-style tripe, start by cleaning it, then put it in a colander and rinse it well under running water, then drain [1]. In the meantime, prepare the chopped aromatic mixture by peeling the carrot and cutting it into cubes [2], do the same with the celery, removing its top leaves, [3]
and then the onion, [4] removing the peel. If you do not wish for an intense flavor, remove its core. Then cut the slice of guanciale [5] into cubes [6].
In a saucepan, pour the extra virgin olive oil together with the chopped celery, carrot, and onion, then add the peeled garlic clove [7], let it season for a few moments over high heat, then add the cubes of guanciale [8] and lastly, the tripe [9].
Pour the white wine [10] and let it evaporate completely, add salt and pepper [11], then the crushed tomatoes [12],
stir everything and let it cook for 2 hours [13], there will be no need to cover or add water, as the tripe will release juices during cooking. After the first hour of cooking, add the mint leaves [14] and continue cooking. After two hours of cooking, remove the garlic clove [15],
Turn off the heat, add the grated pecorino romano cheese [16], stir a few moments [17] and serve the Roman-style tripe hot [18].
