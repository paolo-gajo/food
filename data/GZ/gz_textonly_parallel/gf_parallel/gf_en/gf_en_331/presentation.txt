This preparation is typical of Italian and central European mountain areas, where it is habitually enjoyed in the winter: a hot and restoring treat on the coldest of days, it is also considered by many to be an ancient remedy against seasonal ailments, just like the classic herbal tea.

Versions of this recipe also include different ingredients for seasoning: some use cardamom or ginger, while other also add small pieces of apple to flavor the wine. In any case, the result will be a fragrant, intensely flavored beverage, perfect for serving with chestnuts or a delicious strudel. A sip of mulled wine and it will feel like winter right away!
