To make mulled wine, prepare all the spices you'll need for the recipe, then thinly slice the lemon [1] and orange [2] peel, without removing the white part, which would add a bitter flavor to the preparation. Place the sugar in a steel saucepan that is not too tall [3],
add the cinnamon sticks [4], the juniper berries [5], the cloves [6]
and the star anise [7]. Now add the citrus peel and last of all, the full bodied red wine [8]. Place the saucepan on the fire and slowly bring to the boil; simmer on a low flame for 5 minutes and stir until all the sugar dissolves [9].
Now bring a flame to the surface of the wine: you can use a candle or a wooden skewer; be careful not to burn yourself: this will set the alcohol in the wine on fire: wait for it to burn itself out [10]. When the fire goes out, filter the mulled wine using a very fine meshed colander [11] and serve piping hot [12]. Enjoy your mulled wine!
