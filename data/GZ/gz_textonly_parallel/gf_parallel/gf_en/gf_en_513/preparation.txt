To make your cavatelli with speck, creamy potatoes and arugula, first boil the potatoes in their skins for 30-40 minutes [1] until soft. Cooking time may vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Once cooked, mash them in a pan using a potato masher [2]. Add the cream [3] and heat over a low heat, stirring continuously with a whisk.
Once youâ€™ve achieved a fluid consistency, remove from the stove and blend using an immersion blender [4] until smooth and even [5]. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside [6]. Bring a pan full of salted water to a boil; this will be used to cook the pasta.
Finely dice the speck [7]. Heat a little oil in the pan and add the speck [8] and thyme leaves [9].
Brown until the speck is crispy [10]. Add the arugula, having washed it beforehand [11]. Stir, and allow the arugula to wilt. Meanwhile, cook the cavatelli [12].
Loosen the consistency of the cream by adding in a ladleful of the pasta cooking water [13]. Add the creamed potatoes to the sauce [14]. Once the cavatelli are cooked, drain them into the pan [15].
Add some of the cooking water [16], adjusting the amount depending on the consistency of the sauce. Season with the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [17] and serve your cavatelli with speck, creamy potatoes and arugula nice and hot [18].
