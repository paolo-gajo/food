Do you love desserts with intense aromas, citrus ones in particular? Usually lemon or orange zest is used to flavor cake mixes, like in the classic orange cake. Today, for the orange sponge cake, you'll use a whole orange, including pulp and zest. This sponge cake is so quick to make because all the ingredients are blended together in a mixer. It will take only few minutes to make a creamy and highly aromatic dough that will unleash an irresistible perfume when baked in the oven. Ideal for breakfast or as a delicious snack, the orange sponge cake will surprise you with its soft texture and enveloping flavor. For a different version of this recipe why not try clementine sponge cake and lemon sponge cake, just as aromatic and quick to make, while the peach sponge cake will be an excellent alternative for the summer months!
