To prepare orange sponge cake, slice the oranges and cut them into pieces [1]; now place the ingredients in the mixer (you can use an immersion blender or blend the orange and milk and whisk the rest of the mixture): the sieved flour, the sugar [2], the milk [3]
continue with the seed oil [4], orange pieces [5] and eggs [6].
Add the baking powder last [7]. Switch the mixer on and blend everything to obtain a creamy mixture, and pour it in a bowl [8]. Lastly, add the chocolate drops [9]. Stir them in with a spatula: your dough is ready!
Place it in a buttered mold lined with parchment paper (10-11), then bake the orange sponge cake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 80 minutes. Once baked remove from the oven and leave to cool [12]. Remove from the mold and leave to cool.
Sieve the orange marmalade [13] and brush it over the surface of the cake [14]. Serve the sweet smelling orange sponge cake for breakfast or as a rich snack [15]!
