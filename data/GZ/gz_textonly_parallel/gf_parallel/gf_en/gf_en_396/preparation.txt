To make the gnocchi alla sorrentina, start with the potatoes to make the gnocchi: Wash them under running water to remove any dirt, then place in a large pot, add water [1], and cook for around 30-40 minutes (the time may vary according to the size, so test using the prongs of a fork to see how done they are; if you’d like to reduce the cooking time, you can use a pressure cooker). Next, turn to the sauce: Add a drizzle of oil to a pot along with a whole clove of garlic, crushed, and the tomato puree [2]; season with salt and pepper [3].
Allow the flavors to develop with the basil leaves, then cover with a lid [4] and leave to cook for around 30 minutes over medium/low heat. Drain the potatoes well once they’re ready. Sift flour onto a pastry board and create a well [5]. Using a potato ricer [6], press the still-warm potatoes out into the well in the flour, or peel and mash the potatoes and place in the well.
Add the egg [7] and salt [8] to the potatoes, then start to knead [9]: Do this fairly quickly,
 for just as long as it takes to compact the ingredients [10] and give the dough a uniform and soft (not sticky but not too firm, either) consistency [11]. Cover with a clean, dry dishcloth. Bring water to cook the gnocchi to a boil in a large pot, salting the water once boiling. Meanwhile, take one portion of the dough at a time [12], keeping the rest covered,
and roll into a cylinder around ¾ inch to 1 inch (2-3 cm) thick [13]. Sprinkle with some semolina and cut the gnocchi from the cylinders using a dough cutter [14]. To give them the classic ridges, you can use a gnocchi board [15] or the prongs of a fork.
As you make them, you can put the gnocchi on a tray covered with a clean dishcloth dusted lightly with semolina [16]. Once the gnocchi are ready, remove the garlic from the sauce [17] and pour nearly all of the sauce into a very large bowl [18]; the remaining sauce will be used at the bottom of the baking dish later on.
Boil the gnocchi in the pot in at least 2/3 batches [19]; be sure that the water in the pot is simmering gently and not boiling vigorously to avoid damaging the gnocchi. They’ll only need to cook for a few minutes, and as soon as they’ve risen to the surface, drain using a skimmer and, little by little, add them to the bowl where you put the sauce [20]. Stir gently with a spoon [21].
Pour the remaining sauce into a baking dish, drizzle over some oil [22], and then pour in the gnocchi (23-24).
Cover with a layer of diced mozzarella [25] and a sprinkling of Parmigiano [26]. Then add another layer of gnocchi [27],
the remaining mozzarella and Parmigiano (28-29). Cook your gnocchi alla sorrentina in broil mode in a conventional oven preheated to 480°F (250°C), for 5 minutes. Serve the dish piping hot [30]!
