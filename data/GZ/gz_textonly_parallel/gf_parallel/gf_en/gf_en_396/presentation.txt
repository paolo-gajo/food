One of the dishes from the Campania region that’s most famous both in Italy and abroad is gnocchi alla sorrentina, Sorrento-style gnocchi in tomato and mozzarella sauce – a dish that’s made in restaurants all over the world! What makes this gnocchi dish so well loved is its simplicity: Mediterranean flavors and authenticity combined with easy preparation. Making the gnocchi by hand will remind you of Sundays spent at Grandma’s house figuring out all the secrets behind the perfect consistency of those little potato gnocchi. The gnocchi alla sorrentina are then enveloped in a creamy tomato and basil sauce, jazzed up with mozzarella and grated cheese... Just the ingredients that make gnocchi even nicer by creating a stringy cheese effect after being heated for a short time in the oven. To put a different twist on this dish, try making zucchini gnocchi instead of the classic dough with potatoes. Has your mouth started watering? Come and make some gnocchi alla sorrentina with us!
