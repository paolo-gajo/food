to make fish ravioli, start by sieving the flour in a bowl [1]; crack the 3 eggs open in another bowl, to prevent any pieces of shell from ending up in the dough. Add the eggs to the middle of the flour and start mixing, with a fork [2]; place the resulting dough on a work top and knead it vigorously [3]. Consider that based on the absorption capacity of the flour, you may need a little more if the dough is sticky. We always recommend leaving out around 0.4-0.5 cup and adding it at the end if needed.
Once the dough absorbs the eggs, place it on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour and continue to knead by hand until smooth and homogeneous [4]. Now cover it in plastic wrap and leave to rest at room temperature for around 30 minutes, away from drafts of air. Prepare the filling in the meantime: clean the shrimps by cutting away the head, removing the shell and black string on the back [5].Â Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan, add the whole peeled garlic clove [6];
leave to flavor for a few minutes, then remove the garlic. Add the shrimps [7], brown them for a minute on a high flame, add the brandy [8], simmer and reduce. Once reduced, remove from the heat [9].
Place the cooked shrimps in the mixer, add the salmon [10], the ricotta, add the nutmeg [11] and pepper to taste, but don't add any salt as smoked salmon is already rather salty. Blend into a homogeneous mixture [12].
Season the filling with the thyme leaves [13] and leave to one side. Go back to the fresh pasta, remove the film and split it into two equal parts; cover one piece with plastic wrap so that it does not dry out while you roll the other piece out in the pasta machine [14] until around 0.04 inches thick (setting number 8 on the machine) [15]. You will end up with a long piece of pasta: split it into two equal parts.
Take the ravioli mold, sprinkle with the flour [16], then take one of the two pieces of dough (cover the other with plastic wrap so that it doesn't dry out), gently roll it out using a rolling pin so that it is the same length as the mold, then place it over the mold and delicately press down over each hole to create dips [17]; add a spoon of filling [18] to each one but do not overfill, otherwise you won't be able to seal the ravioli and they'll open up during cooking.
Dab some water onto the edges with a brush so the pasta adheres better [19], cover with the second pasta sheet [20], press it down by hand so that they stick together, then roll the rolling pin over the surface to seal both layers of pasta [21].
Delicately remove the excess pasta [22], turn the mold over to remove the ravioli [23] and place them on a cloth sprinkled with flour [24].
Now prepare the sauce; bring a saucepan filled with water to the boil and add salt to taste, you'll cook the ravioli in it. Add a drizzle of oil to a deep pan, flavor for a couple of minutes with the whole peeled garlic clove [25]. Remove the garlic clove and add the tomato puree; add salt and pepper to taste [26] and cook on a medium flame for around 15 minutes. Once the sauce is ready, boil the ravioli in the salted boiling water (do not simmer too vigorously otherwise the ravioli will open) [27]. Cook for around two minutes or until they float to the surface.
In the meantime, now that the sauce is ready, pour the fresh liquid milk into the pan [28], stir and cook for another couple of minutes on a low flame; when the ravioli float to the surface [29], drain them and add them to the sauce straight away [30].
Delicately stir to prevent the ravioli from opening [31], flavor with a few thyme leaves [32] and serve your fish ravioli nice and hot [33].
