To prepare crostini with mussels and cherry tomatoes, start by cleaning the mussels. Place them to a large bowl and, after washing them carefully under running water, use the back of a knife blade to remove all scale and barnacles [1]. Scrub mussels individually to remove the beard from the valves [2]. Under fresh running water, rub the mussels vigorously using a steel wool pad or a stiff brush [3].
Brown some of the olive oil in a non-stick pan with the unpeeled garlic clove, which you can remove when it turns golden brown [4]. Pour the cleaned mussels [5] into the oil and immediately add the white wine [6].
Place a lid on the saucepan [7] and let it cook on high heat for 5 minutes, which is the time needed for the mussels to open. When they are ready [8], pour the mussels in a strainer, taking care to place a bowl underneath to collect the cooking liquid [9].
Now you can shell the mussels [10], keeping aside the filtered cooking liquid and some whole mussels to serve them next to the crostini (toasted bread) [11].Next, finely chop the fresh parsley [12].
After washing them, cut the cherry tomatoes into quarters [13]. Pour the remaining olive oil in another pan and brown the other unpeeled garlic clove [14], add the cherry tomatoes [15].
As soon as the garlic is golden brown, remove it from the pan with a pair of tongs [16], add the mussels' cooking liquid, lower the heat and let it evaporate for 5-6 minutes [17]: avoid overcooking the tomatoes until they fall apart. Now add the shelled mussels [18] and stir to blend all the flavors for a couple of minutes.
Finally, add the chopped parsley [19] and freshly ground pepper.Now slice a baguette crosswise to obtain 12 slices [20], which you can then place on a baking tray lined with baking paper and drizzle with olive oil [21].
Toast the crostini in a static oven preheated to 360° F (180° C) for 5 minutes, or in grill mode for 2 minutes: in either case, turn each slice over about halfway through. When the crostini are ready, place them on a chopping board [22] and, with the help of a spoon, garnish each one with some tomatoes and 2 mussels [23]. Finish with a sprinkling of salt and pepper [24]. Your crostini (toasted bread) with mussels and cherry tomatoes are ready!
