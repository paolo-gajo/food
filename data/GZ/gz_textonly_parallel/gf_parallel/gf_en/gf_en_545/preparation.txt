To prepare the bicolor ring cake start by leaving the eggs and the cream at room temperature; now melt the butter in a small saucepan and leave to cool until warm. Place the sugar and the eggs in a bowl [1]. Beat for a couple of minutes with the electric whisk on a medium speed, just enough for the mixture to start rising slightly [2]. Whisk for another minute at the same speed and add the melted warm butter [3].
Now for the powders: switch off the whisk, place a colander over the bowl and add the flour [4], potato starch and yeast [5]. Sieve thoroughly and stir some more with the whisk [6].
Once you have stirred the powders into the mixture, switch the whisk off and place half of the batter in another bowl [7]. Sieve the cocoa and add it to one of the bowls [8], then add the cream [9]
and stir thoroughly with a whisk or a spatula by hand [10]. First add the dark batter to half of a previously buttered 9.5" mold (not dusted with flour) to form a semi circle [11], then add the light batter to fill the other half and complete the circle [12].
Your cake is ready to be baked [13] in a static oven preheated to 350Â°F for around 40 minutes [14]. After checking the bicolor ring cake is done by using the toothpick test, leave it to cool until warm before removing from the mold and serving [15]!
