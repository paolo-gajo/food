To prepare a Bellini, start by washing a white peach under plenty of running water [1]. Then dry with a clean cloth [2], and cut into segments without removing the skin [3]. Remove the pit.
Now place the peach into the mixer [4] and blend until it is puréed [5]. Filter the peach purée with a narrow-mesh strainer placed over a bowl [6].
A uniform purée will be obtained [7]. Pour it into a shaker [8] and add very cold brut sparkling wine (or Prosecco wine) [9]. Stir the ingredients briefly with a long-handled spoon.
Place the strainer over the mouth of the shaker and filter the cocktail [10] directly into the flutes [11]. Now serve your Bellini [12]. Cheers!
