The Bellini is an Italian long drink par excellence, prepared with peach purée and sparkling white wine. This cocktail was conceived in 1948 by Giuseppe Cipriani, owner of the well-known Harry's Bar in Venice, for the inauguration of the exhibition of paintings by artist Giovanni Bellini. It is said that the particular pink color of the cassock of a saint portrayed by the painter inspired Cipriani to create this drink. Originally, the cocktail was made with Champagne, white peach pulp, and a touch of raspberry purée, which served to give it a slightly pinkish color. Bellini owes its international fame not only to its pleasant fruity and sweet aroma, but also to the many artists from all over the world and regular visitors to Harry's Bar, who spread the knowledge of this cocktail around the world.
