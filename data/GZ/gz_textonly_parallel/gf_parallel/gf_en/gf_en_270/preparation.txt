To prepare pasta and lentils, start by heating up the filtered vegetable borth: you will need it soon. Then proceed to the preparation of the saut√©ed base: chop the onion, celery, and carrot [1] then, in a large saucepan, pour the oil [2] and add the chopped onion, celery, and carrot [2]. Then add the peeled garlic clove [3].
Deglaze with a ladle of broth [4] and let this mixture stew. In the meantime, cut the pancetta bacon into cubes [5] and place it into the saucepan [6].
Mix all the ingredients well, then, using tongs, remove the garlic clove [7]. Rinse the lentils under running water, using a sieve [8] and add them to the pan [9].
Also add the chopped dried chili pepper [10], mix in the tomato puree [11], and add the sprigs of rosemary and thyme, which you can tie together with kitchen twine [12] so that they are easier to remove later.
Add the broth until the mixture is well covered [13], then cover the saucepan [14] and leave to cook over low heat for about 40 minutes until the lentils are tender. Remove the sprig of herbs [15] and pour in your pasta.
Add a few ladles of broth to cook the pasta [16] and leave to cook for about ten minutes. Once the pasta is ready, you can decide: if you prefer it more watery, add more broth until the desired consistency is obtained. Once the pasta is cooked, season with salt and pepper and add grated parmesan cheese [17]: you can use half a ladle of broth again to help mix in the cheese. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving [18]. Your pasta and lentils are ready to be enjoyed!
