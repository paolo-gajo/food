Our grandmothers might not have called it "comfort food" but, of course, every time they cooked pasta and lentils they did so with a mission: to prepare a hearty and tasty dish, capable of warming up the whole family even on the coldest winter days. Lentils, rich in vitamins, iron, and fiber, are considered an excellent substitute for meat. In this recipe they create a rich first course, flavored with pancetta bacon, which can be prepared more or less watery depending on your preferences. We used ditaloni rigati pasta, but you can take this opportunity to use different pasta shapes left over in your pantry. Pasta and lentils is the perfect antidote to bad weather: a genuine dish to recharge your batteries.
