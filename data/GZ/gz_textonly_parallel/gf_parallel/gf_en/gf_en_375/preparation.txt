To prepare the Ricciarelli, start by finely chopping the almonds with 330 g (11.5 oz) of granulated sugar [1]. Then transfer the mixture to a bowl and mix with a wooden spatula [2]. In a small saucepan, pour the remaining 50 g (1.76 oz) of granulated sugar and water [3], turn on low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar.
You will need to turn off the stove when the sugar starts to coat the spoon [4]. At this point, you can add it to the mixture [5]. Then continue mixing with the wooden spatula [6].
Also add 50 g (1.76 oz) of sifted powdered sugar and flour [7], then pour in the baking powder as well [8]. Continue mixing all the ingredients with a spatula [9].
The prepared dough [10] should rest in the bowl at room temperature for at least 12 hours, covered with a damp cloth [11]. After 12 hours, you can whip the egg whites using an electric mixer [12].
When they have turned white, gradually add the remaining 50 g (1.76 oz) of sifted powdered sugar [13] and a teaspoon of bitter almond extract [14]. Then take the dough you have allowed to rest and break it up with a wooden spatula [15].
Then pour in the whipped egg whites [16], mixing from the bottom up to blend them [17]. Once they are incorporated, start kneading with your hands [18]
and when the dough becomes more uniform [19], transfer it onto a surface dusted with powdered sugar [20]. Then, work it until you achieve a soft and uniform dough. Next, form a small log and use a knife or another tool to cut pieces, each weighing about 25 grams [21].
With the tips of your fingers, you can shape the typical form of the Ricciarelli [22], then cut out the wafer using the Ricciarelli stencil and place it under each cookie [23]. Arrange the Ricciarelli on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [24]
sprinkle them with sifted powdered sugar [25] and bake in a preheated conventional oven for 10 minutes at 230Â°F. The Ricciarelli should be baked but still pale in color [26]. Then, remove them from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving [27]!
