Discover the delight of Ricciarelli, the soft marzipan cookies perfect for sharing with friends and family as a festive holiday treat. Inspired by the traditional Ricciarelli from Siena, these cookies are lovingly crafted with almonds, sugar, and egg whites. After a 12-hour resting period and a gentle mix of all the ingredients, the dough is shaped into its characteristic diamond or 'rice grain' form.
