To prepare the savory eggplant pastry, first wash the eggplants and trim the ends, then cut them into circular slices around ¼ inch (4 mm) thick using a mandoline [1] or a knife. Cut the scamorza into relatively thin slices [2] and roughly chop the dried tomatoes using a knife [3].
Take a cake pan measuring 12x8 inches (30x20 cm) and grease with oil [4]. Gently unroll the puff pastry, separate it from the parchment paper, and lay it on top of the pan [5], then pierce it with the prongs of a fork [6].
Add half of the eggplant slices to form the first layer, overlapping them slightly so as not to leave any gaps [7]. Season with salt and pepper, add half of the sun-dried tomatoes [8] and distribute them evenly over the eggplant. Spread half of the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese over the dried tomatoes [9],
and finally cover with half of the sliced scamorza cheese [10]. Repeat the layers, adding the remaining slices of eggplant [11], salt and pepper, the sun-dried tomatoes [12], 
grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [13], and the scamorza slices. Fold the edges of the puff pastry inwards [14], and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for around 40 minutes or until the surface is nicely golden [15]. Your savory eggplant pastry is ready to serve piping hot!
