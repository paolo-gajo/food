To prepare the spaghetti with mussels, start by cleaning them. Rinse; under running water, eliminate the barnacles and all the impurities present with a knife [2] and the byssus, that is the beard that you find on the edge of each mussel, simply removing it with your fingers [3].
Pour the oil into a large saucepan together with a peeled clove of garlic [4] and let it season for 1-2 minutes over low heat. As soon as it is hot enough, remove the garlic [5], and add the mussels [6].
and cover immediately [7]. Cook for 2-3 minutes, so that the mussels can open completely [8]. While cooking, shake the pan from time to time to stir. Before draining the mussels, place them in a sterile gauze-lined colander, which will act as a filter, collecting any impurities and sand residue [9].
Then shell them, keeping some for the final decoration of the dish if desired [10]. Wash and dry the parsley, then finely chop it [11] and pour it into a pan with a little oil and a clove of garlic [12], and cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add some shelled mussels [13], so as to further flavor the base and, after 1-2 minutes remove the garlic and add the tomato puree [14] together with some cooking liquid from the clams [15].
Cover with a lid [16] and leave to simmer for 20 minutes. In the meantime, put a pot with plenty of water on the stove, as soon as it boils, salt and cook the pasta [17]. When the pasta has 2-3 minutes left to cook, add the shelled mussels [18]
and the previously drained spaghetti [19]. Toss the pasta by adding the remaining liquid from the mussels [20] and when it is cooked, add the pepper and make sure the salt is right. All you have to do now is plate and serve your spaghetti with mussels [21].
