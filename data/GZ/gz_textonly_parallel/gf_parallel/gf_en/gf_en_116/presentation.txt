The bright red color of the tomato and the irresistible scent of the sea given off by the  mussels  are the two main ingredients of the dressing, which we are preparing for today's lunch. It is spaghetti with mussels, a very simple first course that always brings most people together. After a good fish appetizer, what could be better than a tasty and enveloping dish in which the acidity of the tomato is mitigated by the sweetness of the clams, and the aroma enhanced to its fullest thanks to chopped parsley. Our kitchen is now invaded by this tempting smell, and lovers of fish dishes will agree: we can't wait to taste the spaghetti with mussels, come prepare them with us!
