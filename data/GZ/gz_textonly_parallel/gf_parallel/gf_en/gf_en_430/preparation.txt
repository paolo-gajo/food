To prepare the fig cake, start with the batter: Cut the butter (at room temperature) into chunks and place in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugar [1] and run at medium-low speed until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat the eggs with a fork in a bowl and then gradually add them to the mixture [2] until they are well blended. Then add a pinch of salt and, while the mixer is running, the grated lemon zest [3].
With the mixer still running, sift the cake flour, almond flour [4], and baking powder [5] into a separate bowl and add this to the mixer bowl one spoonful at a time [6].
When the powdered ingredients are well blended, add the milk at room temperature [7]. Continue blending this batter until the milk is absorbed. Now pour the batter into a buttered and floured 9-inch (22-cm) springform cake pan [8]. Using a spatula, spread and level the mixture evenly in the pan [9].
Now move onto the figs: Peel them [10], then cut them into slices that are fairly thin [11]. Go back to the cake pan and start arranging the fig slices in a circle; start at one point [12]
and keep adding the other figs until you’ve covered the entire surface, beginning at the outside and working your way in toward the center [13]. Garnish the surface with the sliced almonds [14] and sprinkle with brown sugar [15].
Once you’ve finished topping the cake [16], bake in a conventional oven preheated to 340°F (170°C) for 40-45 minutes. As the cake bakes, the raw sugar will add an amber sheen to the surface. If you find it too dark after the first half hour of baking, cover with foil for the rest of the baking time. Once baked, do the toothpick test: Pierce the cake with a toothpick, and if it comes out dry and clean, this means that the cake is ready [17]. Once you’ve taken it out of the oven, leave it to cool and then remove it from the pan [18]. Your cake is ready to be enjoyed!
