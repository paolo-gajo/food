Strozzapreti pasta with octopus sauce is a flavorful seafood first course that’s great on its own or as the main course for a fish-based lunch or dinner. Get yourself a really fresh octopus and use it to make the sauce we’ve got for you today, with an aroma that will take you straight to the beach. The softness of the octopus pairs perfectly with the tomato passata delicately scented with the thyme, which will combine with this special fresh pasta to release unique flavors. Strozzapreti pasta with octopus sauce is a totally Mediterranean recipe inspired by classic octopus stew, since fishing and eating octopus is so common around this sea.
