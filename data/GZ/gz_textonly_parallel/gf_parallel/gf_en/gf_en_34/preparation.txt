To prepare the vegetable soup, start by washing a drying the vegetables. Now take the pumpkin and peel it using a knife with a large blade [1]. Remove the seeds and white strings, using a spoon [2]. Now cut it into slices that are equal in size, then dice into 1 cm sized cubes [3].
Wash and tip the zucchini, cut them into slices [4] and dice them [5]. Now shell the beans [6],
cut the cauliflower in half, remove the core and cut off the florets [7]; now remove the outermost and greener part of the leeks and cut into thin rings [8]. Peel the potatoes [9] and cut them into slices that are not too thin,
then dice [10]. Prepare the tomatoes: remove the stalks, slice [11] and dice them [12].
Lastly, prepare the ingredients for the saut? base: finely chop up the onion [13]. Tip and peel the carrots, cut them into strips [14] and finely chop them using a knife [15].
Finely chop the celery too [16]. To finish off, tie the rosemary sprigs together with the bay leaves to create a bouquet garni [17]. Now all the ingredients for preparing the vegetable minestrone are ready. Take a capacious pot with a lid and add the oil [18],
carrots, celery, onion and leek [19] and gently brown for around 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Once the saut? base vegetables become tender, add the bouquet garni [20] and the beans [21].
Cover with water: the vegetables [22] must be covered by a finger span of water. Bring to the boil and cook for 2 minutes. Add the pumpkin [23] and repeat the same procedure: add water, cover with a finger span of water [24], wait for the water to return to the boil and cook for 2 minutes.
Repeat with the potatoes (25-26), followed by the cauliflower [27].
Cover with some more water [28], cover with the lid [29] and cook for 25 minutes once the soup is brought to the boil. Once the 25 minutes are up, add the zucchini [30],
peas [31] and the tomatoes [32], add more water if necessary, add salt and pepper [33] and once brought back to the boil, cook for a further 2-3 minutes.
Remove the bouquet garni [34]. The soup is ready [35]: serve it with a drizzle of oil and some ground pepper to taste [36].
