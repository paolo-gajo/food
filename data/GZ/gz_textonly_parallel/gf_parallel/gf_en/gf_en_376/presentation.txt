Compared to French meringue, Italian meringue (also known as cooked meringue) has a more elaborate preparation process, which requires a syrup thermometer. Once the egg whites have been beaten stiffly, slowly add sugar syrup brought to a temperature of 250째F (120째C) (stirring constantly): stop stirring only when the mixture has completely cooled. Italian-style meringue can be used in the same way as French meringue and is perfect for making mousse to top cakes, to be placed a few minutes under a grill to darken, for fruit mousse, for making cassata, parfait, or as a base for buttercreams. The cooking temperature depends on the size of the meringues and the power of the oven, but it generally should never exceed 215째 F (100째C).
