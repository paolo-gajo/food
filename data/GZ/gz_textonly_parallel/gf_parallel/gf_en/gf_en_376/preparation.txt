To make Italian meringue, pour the water into a heavy-bottomed saucepan [1], add the sugar and cook over low heat [2], stirring to dissolve it. Immerse the food thermometer [3], which will indicate the temperature to be reached, i.e. 250° F (120° C).
When the temperature of the syrup reaches 235° F (114° C), place the egg whites in a stand mixer equipped with a whisk [4] (or use an electric blender) and whip them at medium speed [5]. When the syrup has reached 250° F (120° C), lower the speed of the stand mixer (to prevent the syrup from dispersing on the walls of the bowl), pour half of the syrup into the egg whites [6] and then increase the speed again. Wait a few seconds and keep pouring the syrup slowly, without pouring it directly onto the whisk. Continue to whip until the meringue has cooled down completely.
The meringue mixture must be very dense, smooth, and shiny [7] and can only be cooked when it is completely cold. Pour the meringue into a pastry bag [8], choosing the nozzle according to your intended use, and form the meringues by squeezing the mixture on a baking tray lined with baking paper. You can create classic cloud meringues using a wide star-shaped nozzle [9].
You can form the shells by using a star-shaped nozzle [10], swirls by rotating while squeezing the meringue with a smooth nozzle [11]. Draw the outline on baking paper with a pencil to make it easier. Bake the meringues in a static oven preheated to 140-160° F (60-70°C) and let them dry for at least 4 hours leaving the oven door slightly ajar, in order to avoid any condensation that would prevent them from drying properly (humidity is a bitter enemy of meringues). Once cooked, turn off the heat and leave the meringues in the oven with the door ajar, and let them cool and dry completely for at least a couple of hours.
