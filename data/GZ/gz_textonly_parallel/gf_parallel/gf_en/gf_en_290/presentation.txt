An eight-pointed star, the sweetest and softest there is: we are talking about pandoro, one of the symbolic recipes of Christmas together with its all-time rival, panettone. The firs one from the Veronese pastry tradition (actually of Viennese origins) and the other from Lombardy, one of the most favorite dessert during the holidays to be enjoyed on its own or with delicious mascarpone cream. At the court of the Habsburgs, pandoro was called the "Bread of Vienna", while others trace its name back to the "pan de oro" (meaning golden bread), the sweet that was served in the homes of wealthy Venetians.
