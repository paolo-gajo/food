To prepare sorrisi, start by making the base dough. Place the milk in a saucepan, add the butter [1] and a tea spoon of salt. Bring to just before the boil, then add the flour all in one go [2].?Stir briskly with a spatula [3] or a wooden ladle.?
The dough will become firm in a few moments [4], continue cooking it for a little while longer, until it comes away from the sides of the saucepan and forms a layer at the bottom [5]. Now place it in a low and wide container; press down gently and leave to cool.
Once cooled, place the dough [7] on a top and add a pinch of flour [8]. Knead it once more [9].
Roll it out on a pastry board [10] until nearly 0.4 inches thick and cut into disc [11] using a 4 inch shaping ring mold [12].
Knead any left-over scraps of dough [13], roll them out and cut using the mold: you should be able to make 8 [14].  Now finely chop the mozzarella and place around a third of a cup in a bowl. Add the tomato puree [15].
Stir thoroughly [16] and place a heaped spoon in the middle of a disc [17]. Fold it in half and seal to form a crescent shape [18].
Gently pinch the sides to seal them shut [19]. In this way you will make 3. Then make 2 with just diced mozzarella [20] and another 3 with ham and mozzarella [21].
In total you'll make 8 sorrisi [22]. Now heat abundant oil to 320?. In the meantime, coat the sorrisi in the egg [23] and then in the breadcrumbs, to which you will have added a pinch of salt [24].
Once you have thoroughly breaded the sorrisi and the oil is nice and hot, you can fry them. Immerse a few at a time [25] and fry for a few minutes until golden [26]. Drain the sorrisi using a skewer and place them on a tray lined with oil-absorbing cooking paper [27]. Serve them piping hot!
