To prepare the chocolate salami, first take the ingredients out of the refrigerator so that they are at room temperature. Chop the dark chocolate with a knife [1] and melt it in the microwave or in a bain-marie [2], then let it cool. Meanwhile, pour the butter and sugar into a separate bowl [3] and start working with a whip.
When you have reduced the butter to cream, pour the rum slowly while continuing to mix [4]. Finally add the warm chocolate [5], give a quick stir and also add the unswetened cocoa powder, making sure to mix everything until you get a homogeneous mixture [6].
Crumble the dry biscuits with your hands [7] and add them to the chocolate mixture [8], then mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly [9].
Now take a sheet of baking paper and pour the mixture into the center, shaping it with your hands to give it a cylindrical shape [10]. Lift the bottom flap and wrap the paper around the cylinder [11], then roll up the ends to seal it [12].
Transfer the roll to the refrigerator and let it harden for at least 2-3 hours [13]. After this time, remove the baking paper [14] and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Your chocolate salami is ready to be sliced and enjoyed [15]!
