With chocolate, biscuits, butter and sugar you can make one of the most loved desserts in home cooking, the chocolate salami! Also called Turkish salami or Viking salami depending on the region of Italy, it owes its name to the resemblance to a real sausage both for the shape and for the white coating made with icing sugar. Each family has its own recipe: we have chosen to make the chocolate salami without eggs and flavor it with a drop of rum, but you can try many other delicious variations such as coffee, nougat or exotic fruits. Perfect for a snack, for a birthday or for a simple end of a meal, chocolate salami has always been an irresistible temptation for young and old!
