Sea bass in a herb salt crust is a tasty and aromatic main course that involves baking the fish in a tasty shell made from a mixture of egg whites, salt, and herbs. Unlike conventional oven baking, salt baking is one of the oldest and healthiest methods of cooking food, avoiding the need for any additional condiments and allowing the steam produced from the natural moisture within the fish to cook it, thus maintaining both its flavor and its softness. Contrary to what you might think, sea bass in a herb salt crust is actually extremely simple to make. In fact, once youâ€™re familiar with this recipe, you could even try it using beer to even further enhance the fragrance! This fish course is great served with classic roasted potatoes or with a peperonata in summer!
