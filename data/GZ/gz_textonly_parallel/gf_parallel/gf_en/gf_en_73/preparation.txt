To prepare tagliatelle with radicchio and speck, start by chopping all the ingredients you'll need. Start with the shallot: peel and finely chop it with a knife [1]. Then cut the speck into sticks of the same length and thickness [2], so that they cook evenly. Lastly, prepare the radicchio by removing the outermost leaves [3].
Cut it in half lengthwise [4], cut away the tough part of the stalk [5] and then slice the radicchio into thin strips [6].
Leave the shallot to sweat on a low flame in a non-stick pan, with a drizzle of oil, for 4-5 minutes. Add the strips of speck and cook for another 4 minutes [7]. Add the milk [8] and the tomato puree [9].
Add salt and pepper to taste, cook for 6-7 minutes, to thicken [10]. In the meantime, cook the pasta in boiling salted water [11], remove half way into the cooking time and finish cooking directly in the saucepan, together with the sauce [12]. In this way you'll create a more intense flavor and enhance the creaminess of this dish.
Once cooked, add the radicchio julienne [13] and stir [14]. The tagliatelle with radicchio and speck are ready now [15], simply enjoy them while they're still piping hot!
