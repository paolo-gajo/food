To prepare Carnival cassatelle, place the flour, sugar [1], a pinch of salt and 2 eggs at room temperature [2] in a large bowl, along with the diced butter, cold but not straight from the refrigerator [3],
flavor with the lemon peel [4] and orange peel [5] and lastly with the marsala wine [6].
Mix the ingredients by hand [7], collect the liquid and then place the dough on a pastry board [8]; knead until smooth and firm [9].
Cover with plastic wrap [10] and leave to rest for 30 minutes out of the refrigerator. In the meantime, prepare the filling; finely chop the chocolate using a knife [11], be sure not to leave any large pieces because they could pierce the dough as it cooks. Place the ricotta di pecora cheese and sugar [12] in a bowl, 
flavor with the cinnamon [13] and add the previously chopped chocolate [14]. Thoroughly stir all the ingredients together using a fork [15].
Leave the filling to one side [16], take the cassatelle dough and divide it in half [17], then roll it out with the pasta making machine set to 7, for a thickness of around 0.04 inches.
After rolling the pastry out, divide the rectangle in half and cut into discs using a shaping ring mold with a 4.53 inch diameter [19]. Place a spoon of the mixture in the middle of each disc [20], dab a little water around the edge [21] to seal the dough around the filling.
Close the cassatelle to form a crescent shape and thoroughly seal the edges by pressing down with the back of your hand [22]. Cut the edge of the semi-circle out with a serrated shaping ring mold and remove the part containing the filling, to create a decorated edge [23]. Repeat until you finish the dough: with these amounts you'll make around 20 pieces. When ready you can fry your Carnival cassatelle: heat the seed oil in a deep pan and when it reaches 340°F (170°C) (measure with a cooking thermometer), delicately add a few cassatelle at a time [24] so that the temperature of the oil doesn't drop too much.
Cook the cassatelle for around 3 minutes; once cooked [25], drain on absorbent paper [26]. Leave to cool slightly before sprinkling the Carnival cassatelle with powdered sugar to taste, then serve!
