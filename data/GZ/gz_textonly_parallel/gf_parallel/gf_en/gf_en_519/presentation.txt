At Carnival anything goes, as long as it's sweet! Us Italians know this all too well, as we have invented a different fried sweet in every region, for enjoying on occasion of the most colorful and cheerful celebration of the year (or at other times): bugie, castagnole, tortelli, stuffed chiacchiere ...an infinite selection! With the Carnival cassatelle recipe, after the one for fried milk, let's take a virtual trip once more to sunny Sicily, where these sweets, similar to sweet ravioli and with a memorable flavor, will win us over. The fragrant puff pastry, fried a tantalizingly golden color, envelop a delicious and rich filling. Ricotta di pecora cheese and chocolate: a pairing true to Sicilian culinary tradition loved by everyone, and we're no exception! This is why we wanted to offer our take on this delicacy available in many different and equally delicious versions!
