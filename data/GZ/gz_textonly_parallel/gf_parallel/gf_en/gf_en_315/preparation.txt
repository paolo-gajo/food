To make the Nutella liqueur, start by pouring the milk and cream [1] into a large pot, and then add the Nutella [2]. Mix vigorously with a whisk to combine all the ingredients and stop lumps from forming [3]. Then begin to heat gently. Once the mixture is warm, but before it’s reached a boil, and the Nutella is fully melted, turn off the heat and remove the pot from the stove. Leave the mixture to cool completely. Keep whisking it every now and then to prevent a film from forming on top.
Once the mixture has cooled completely, add the alcohol [4] and blend it well into the other ingredients. Finally, pour into clean bottles that you’ll keep it in [5] and allow to cool completely for at least 10 minutes. We used a glass container with an airtight closure [6]. Let the Nutella liqueur rest for at least 20-30 days before drinking it!
