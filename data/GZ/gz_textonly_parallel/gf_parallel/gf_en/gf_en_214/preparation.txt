To make the potato frittata, first finely chop the parsley with a knife [1]. Then peel the potatoes and cut them into slices 2/5 inch (1 cm) thick [2]. Bring a pot full of water to a boil and then blanch the sliced potatoes for 4-5 minutes [3].
Now pour the eggs into a bowl, add the grated cheese [4], chopped parsley then salt [5] and pepper [6].
Mix the ingredients [7]. Drain the potatoes that have finished cooking [8], let them cool and then add them to the egg mixture [9].
In a pan heat a drizzle of seed oil, and once it is hot, pour in the mixture [10]. Cover with the lid [11] and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, turning the pan occasionally. When the surface is not very soft but still moist, carefully flip the frittata onto the lid by turning the pan with a firm and rapid movement [12].
Slide the frittata back into the pan so that the other side is also cooked, cover again with the lid [13] and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. After this, the frittata will be ready [14], you can serve it hot or cold [15].
