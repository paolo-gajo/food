To makeÂ zucchini and scamorza risotto, start by preparing the vegetable broth and keep it hot. In the meantime, slice the ingredients you'll need: thinly slice the spring onion [1] and cut the zucchini into four lengthwise [2] and then into triangles [3].
Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the spring onion [4] and brown for a couple of minutes. Add the rice [5] and toast for at least another couple of minutes, stirring all the while [6].
Now add the zucchini [6], salt [7] and the hot broth, one ladle at a time, wait until it is completely absorbed before adding any more [8].
In the meantime, finely dice the scamorza [10]. Once the rice is cooked and creamy, remove from the heat and add the pepper [11] and the finely chopped parsley [12].
Last off, add the scamorza [13] and stir until nice and thick [14]. Place on plates and garnish with a drizzle of raw oil. Serve your zucchini and scamorza risotto immediately [15]!
