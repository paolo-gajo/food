Pavlova is an iconic cake with an unmistakable appearance: an elegant meringue filled with whipped cream and a cascade of fresh, colorful fruit! Australia and New Zealand have always contended the origin of this recipe, but its name is actually dedicated to a famous Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, whose tour of both countries in the 1920s was a resounding success. The shape and whiteness of pavlova pay tribute to her elegance, which enchanted theater audiences the world over. The meringue base is different from the original one as it is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, for a unique consistency that you too can achieve if you follow our tips and advice, step by step! Challenge yourself and make your most beautiful pavlova yet, by choosing whatever filling you prefer: kiwi and wild berries in pure New Zealand style, or passion fruit just like in the Australian version, or with chocolate cream, lemon or yogurt for an alternative flavor?
