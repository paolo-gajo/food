To make pavlova, start by heating a static oven to 266F, then separate the yolks from the whites: be sure to use eggs at room temperature. Place the egg whites in the bowl of a planetary mixer fitted with a whisk [1] and switch it on at a medium-high speed. Wait for the egg whites to turn white in color, then gradually add the sugar [2]. After adding all the sugar the meringue will become dense and creamy; now add the lemon juice [3].
Add the vanilla extract too [4] and wait until absorbed: by now, the meringue will be firm in consistency [5]; switch the planetary mixer off and add the corn starch [6].
Delicately stir with a spatula from the bottom up, so as not to deflate the mixture [7], then place mixture on an oven tray lined with parchment paper. Use a spatula to shape the meringue into the shape of a mountain [8] and smooth the surface [9].
Delicately create a well [10] and shape the sides with a smaller spatula, from the bottom up [11]. Bake the meringue in a preheated oven at 266F for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 212F and bake for another 50 minutes, without ever opening the door [12]. Once this time is up, switch the oven off and leave the pavlova to cool for at least 2 hours, with the oven shut.
Once the pavlova has cooked, prepare the decorations: cut the kiwi in half, then into crescents [13]; cut the strawberries into four pieces [14]. Lastly, wash and dry the wild berries. Now prepare the whipped cream: place the fresh liquid milk in a bowl with the powdered sugar [15].
Beat with an electric whisk until firm and creamy [16]. You are now ready to fill the pavlova: delicately tap on the surface [17] to lightly crack the meringue and delicately widen the cavity [18].
Fill the cavity with the whipped cream [19] and decorate with the fresh fruit [20] [21].
Garnish with the fresh mint leaves [22] and lightly dust with the powdered sugar [23]. Your wonderful pavlova is ready to be served [24]!
