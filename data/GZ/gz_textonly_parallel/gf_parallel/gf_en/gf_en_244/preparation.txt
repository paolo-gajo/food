To make penne al baffo, first, wash, dry, and finely chop the parsley [1]. Put it aside and move on to the ham, cutting it into thin slices [2]. Heat up a pot full of water, salted to taste, which will be used to cook the pasta. Now, go back to making the sauce: Pour a drizzle of oil into a pot, add the ham and let it brown for about a minute [3], 
then add the cream as well [4]. Stir to combine, add the tomato puree [5] and let this cook for around 10 minutes over low heat [6]. 
Meanwhile, cook the pasta [7], and once it’s al dente, drain it and pour straight into the pot with the sauce [8]. Season with salt and pepper to taste [9];
add the chopped parsley [10], stir to combine [11], and serve your penne al baffo while still hot [12].
