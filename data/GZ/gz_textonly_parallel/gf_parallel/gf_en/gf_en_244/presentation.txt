Looking for a first-course dish that’s truly tasty, appealing, and ready in just 20 minutes? Well, here you go! Penne al baffo (penne pasta with ham and cream sauce) is a recipe that’s perfect for a family lunch, when you don’t have much time to cook but still want something full of flavor... and even for when some hungry friends are about to arrive! Just a few simple steps will guarantee an amazing result... The penne pasta is great for this kind of sauce since it will absorb the velvety cream and tomato sauce, giving you a tasty mouthful with every bite! We’ve chosen to liven up the creamy sauce with some ham, but there are lots of different versions: You can use speck (lightly smoked ham) or go for something completely different by using cubes of fish or squid! We recommend trying all of them and choosing the one that’s just right for you.
