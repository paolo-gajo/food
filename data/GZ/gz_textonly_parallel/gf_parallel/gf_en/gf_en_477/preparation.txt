To prepare the choux dough, first pour the water, milk, salt and sugar [2] into a saucepan. Add the diced butter [3]
and bring it all to a boil. Now add the flour all at once [4] and stir with a spatula or wooden ladle. Don not worry about lumps and stir quickly, then cook the roux until a white patina forms on the bottom of the pan [5], it will take at least 2-3 minutes. Transfer the resulting dough into a bowl [6],
and add one egg at a time [7] stirring constantly with a spatula. Do not worry if the dough looks separate at first, just keep stirring. Only when it is completely absorbed do you add the next one [8]. Continue stirring to obtain a smooth and consistent dough [9]. Then transfer it inside a pastry bag, with a smooth 1/2" (12-13 mm) nozzle.
At this point, take a baking pan and line it with baking paper; to make the paper stick, squeeze a bit of the dough into the corners and center. Gently squeeze walnut-size dollops of dough, spacing them apart (10-11). Using a slightly wet spoon, lightly press the surface of the balls to flatten the top of each one [12].
Then beat the yolk in a bowl with a little water [13]  and use it to brush the surface of the choux pastry [14]; this will give it a uniform color. Cook in a static oven at 440° F (220° C) for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Avoid opening the oven at this stage; after this time, finish cooking at 350° F (180° C) for another 15-20 minutes, venting the stove a bit by inserting a small ball of aluminum foil between the oven door and frame. If you prefer to bake the choux pastry using a ventilated oven, you will need to heat the oven to 440° F (220° C), put the pastry in, reduce the temperature to 350° F (180° C), and wait about 20-25 minutes. Take out the choux [15] and let them cool before filling them.
