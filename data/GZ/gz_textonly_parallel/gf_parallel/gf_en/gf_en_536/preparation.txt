To prepare the breadsticks, start by taking a little warm water from the 1.25 cups (280 ml) indicated and dissolve the brewer's yeast and malt [1]. Place the remaining lukewarm water in another container and dissolve the salt [2]. Place the sifted flour in a mixer bowl and add the mixture of water, yeast and malt [3], use the bread hook and
also add the oil that you have mixed with the water and salt [4]. Knead until you obtain an elastic compound [5] and transfer onto a pastry board sprinkled with durum wheat flour. Shape the dough into a rectangle, brush it with extra virgin olive oil [6] and sprinkle it with durum wheat flour. Then let the dough rise until it has doubled in volume.
After the time needed for rising (about 1 h), with a long, smooth bladed knife cut the dough on the short side into strips of about 1/2 in. (1 cm) each [7]. Take each strip of dough with both hands at both ends and pull it until it reaches the length of the baking tray you will use to bake it on [8]. Place the breadsticks well apart on a baking tray lined with baking paper [9] and bake them at 400° F (200°C) for about 20 minutes until they begin to brown. If they don't look perfect, don't worry, that's what's special about them. The thinner parts of the breadstick will be crunchy and the thicker parts will be a little softer, so if you want to prepare even more inviting and delicious breadsticks before baking them, brush them with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle them with poppy seeds or sesame seeds!
