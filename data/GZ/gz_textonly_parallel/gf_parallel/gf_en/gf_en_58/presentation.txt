Apparently they were originally yellow in color, although many have reddened and a few have become greener (no anger or jealousy involved here though). Guessed it? We're talking about tomatoes and the numerous varieties of this vegetable grown in gardens. We thought of bringing a few together, to prepare this wonderful tomato tart! A delicious rustic cake for serving hot, warm or cold, whatever you prefer, bringing a touch of color and flavor to your table. So, the tomato varieties we've chosen range from the classic to more unusual ones. Sweet date tomatoes, well-balanced cherry tomatoes, yellow cherry tomatoes and last but not least, marinda, a crisp and subtly savory variety. This tomato tart is a veritable triumph of goodness, don't you think? What are you waiting for, try our recipe and let us know!
