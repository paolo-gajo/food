To prepare the pennette alla boscaiola, start by cleaning the mushrooms. Remove any excess earth, first with a small knife [1], then with a slightly damp cloth (or a special brush) [2]. Then cut them into slices around 1/4 inch (5 mm) thick [3].
Bring a pot full of water to a boil and season with salt. Meanwhile, turn to the pancetta: Slice it and then cut it into cubes of about ¼ inch (0.5 cm) [4]. Warm the oil in a frying pan and fry the pancetta over high heat, stirring often [5]. This will only take a few minutes; then you can set the pancetta aside [6].
Peel and chop an onion [7], then add it to the pan that you used to fry the pancetta: Let it soften [8] for a few minutes before adding the mushrooms [9]. Brown for around 5 minutes, stirring every so often.
Now add the tomato purée [10] and cook over low heat for around 5-10 minutes. Once the sauce has reduced, add the pancetta you set aside [11], and then cook for 5 more minutes [12]. In the meantime, start to cook the pasta, which you should drain once it’s al dente.
Keeping the heat low, finally add the cream [13] to the sauce and stir to combine [14]. Chop the fresh parsley [15] 
and then drain the pennette and add them straight to the pan with the sauce [16]. Stir the pasta into the sauce and sprinkle over the chopped parsley [17] and pepper (and salt if needed) to taste. Give the pennette alla boscaiola a couple of minutes in the pan to make it extra creamy, and then it’s ready to be served [18]!
