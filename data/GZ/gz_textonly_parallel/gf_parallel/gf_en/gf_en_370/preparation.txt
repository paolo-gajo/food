To prepare the lasagna rolls, start with the sauce. Pour a little oil into a pot and let the onion sweat for 5-6 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally [1]. Pour in the tomato puree [2] and a pinch of salt and allow to reduce, covered with a lid, for around 20 minutes over low heat [3].
In the meantime, take another pot and heat a little more oil together with a peeled clove of garlic [4]. Once this is hot, add the spinach [5] and a pinch of salt, and cover with the lid before leaving to cook for 4-5 minutes [6].
After this time, remove the garlic [7] and leave the spinach to cool for a few moments before chopping with a knife [8]. Next, place it in a bowl along with the ricotta [9]
and add the grated cheese [10], salt, pepper [11], and nutmeg [12].
Stir to combine [13]. Slice the mozzarella [14] and place it on a tray lined with paper towel or a clean tea towel [15]. 
Now move on to the pasta. Place the wavy lasagna sheets into a pot containing plenty of salted water and cook until al dente [16]. Then, drain them and place a tray lined with a cloth and leave to cool [17]. Next, add the filling to the lasagna sheets, leaving ½ inch (1 cm) free around the edges [18], 
and roll them up [19]. Once all of your rolls are ready, pour around half of the sauce into a casserole dish [20], arrange the rolls on top [21], 
and cover them with the remaining sauce [22]. If it’s too dry, you can always dilute it with a little water. Next, cut the sliced mozzarella into sticks [23] and sprinkle over the lasagna, adding a sprinkling of grated cheese [24] to the mozzarella.
Bake in a conventional oven [25] preheated to 390°F (200°C) for around 10 minutes, followed by a few minutes under the broiler. Allow to cool for a minute before sprinkling with pepper and basil [26], and your lasagna rolls are ready to enjoy [27]!
