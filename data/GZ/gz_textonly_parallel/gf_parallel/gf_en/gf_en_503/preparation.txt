To prepare your chicken bites with yogurt and turmeric, first remove from chicken breast any cartilage and bones and cut it into cubes of equal size [1]. Transfer the chicken to a bowl, add salt [2], flour [3] and mix well to coat the meat evenly.
Remove the excess flour with a sieve [4] and cook. Heat the oil in a pan, pour the pine nuts [5] and toast them for a few minutes over high heat [5]. When the pine nuts are golden, add the floured chicken nuggets [6], mix and let them brown for a few minutes, always on high heat,
then blend with water [7]. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: add the turmeric to the yogurt in a bowl [8] and mix the mixture well [9].
Pour the sauce into the pan [10] and stir over low heat for a few seconds, just long enough to mix it [11]. Your chicken bites with yogurt and turmeric are ready to be served [12]!
