To make this stuffed mozzarella roll, start by placing the mozzarella in a bowl (preferably one just a little bigger than the mozzarella), together with the water it comes in, and add more water until the mozzarella is completely covered [1]. Then microwave at 900 W for 7 minutes to melt the mozzarella. In the meantime, wash and thinly slice the cluster tomatoes [2], and prepare the arugula and prosciutto slices. Once the mozzarella has softened [3],
use a spoon to transfer it to a sheet of parchment paper [4]. Place another sheet on top, then roll out the mozzarella with a rolling pin [5]. This step should be done as quickly as possible, since mozzarella tends to solidify quickly, making it difficult to roll out. Try to obtain a thin rectangle a few millimeters (?”) thick and measuring around 14” x 10” (35 x 25 cm) [6].
Gently remove the upper sheet of parchment paper [7], season with salt [8], and fill the rectangle with the sliced prosciutto [9].
Next, dress with the slices of cluster tomato and the arugula [10], and finally add another layer of sliced prosciutto[11]. Using the parchment paper to help you, roll the whole thing up, holding tightly as you roll up the filling [12].
Once ready [13], leave the roll to rest in the refrigerator wrapped in the parchment paper for at least 10 minutes. After this time, remove the parchment paper and cut the roll into rounds of about 1” (2.5 cm) thick (you should get 12) [14]. Your stuffed mozzarella roll is ready to be served as an appetizer [15]!
