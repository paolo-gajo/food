To prepare your lemon sorbet start by placing the egg white in a bowl and whisk [1]. When the egg white is semi-whipped, you will notice as a little froth will form on the surface, sprinkle 2 tbsp of sugar over them and continue whisking all the while [2]. As soon as the mixture becomes white and frothy it is ready: leave it to one side [3].
Squeeze the lemons to obtain 0.75 cups of juice [4], filter in a fine mesh colander to remove any pulp [5], and place the juice in a container into which you have already added the water [6].
Whisk and add the remaining 0.75 cup of sugar [7], then gradually add the egg whites [8] so as not to deflate the soft mixture. After thoroughly mixing the ingredients together, add the limoncello and stir some more [9].
Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker (follow instructions for your machine) [10] and switch it on. As soon as the sorbet acquires a classic creamy consistency, which will take around 40 minutes [11], place it in glasses and serve your lemon sorbet garnished with zest [12].
