As bright as the sun in color, with an unmistakably vibrant aroma and a zesty, irresistible flavor, lemon is a citrus fruit that is perfect for seasoning, adding flavor, perfume and color to savory dishes and desserts, in the form of juice or colorful zest! Today it plays a leading role in a dessert we have all enjoyed at least once in our lives: lemon sorbet. A fresh, thirst-quenching flavor and a delicately tart after-taste make this creamy cold dessert a masterpiece, perfect for serving at the end of a meal as a digestive. But is this the only moment in which lemon sorbet can be served? Of course not: try it as a snack or during a break at the office, when you return from a nice walk or after a long day at work. In short, any time is the right time for some homemade lemon sorbet!
