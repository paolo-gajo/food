To prepare Bari style focaccia, place the flour in a bowl [1]. Place the brewers yeast in another bowl and add 1.76 oz of water [2] and stir with a teaspoon to dissolve it [3].
Add the water in which you dissolved the yeast to the flour [4], and start kneading. Now add the salt [6] and remaining water, to dissolve it [6].
Knead thoroughly by hand to obtain a homogeneous mixture [7], then add the sugar [8] and continue to stir. Place the dough on a work top [9].
Knead by hand until smooth [10], then roll the dough into a ball [11], sprinkle with a little flour and cover with a clean cloth [12]. Leaven for an hour, away from drafts of air.
In the meantime, thoroughly wash the pear tomatoes and press to break them up into pieces [13]. Now take a 14 inch tray that is 2.17 inches tall. Generously grease the bottom [14] and add the dough [15].
Delicately press down by hand to stretch it out [16] and pour the oil onto the surface [17], press down with your fingers to make dips and stretch the dough out [18].
Add the pressed tomatoes and spread them over the entire surface [19], interspersed with the halved tomatoes [20]. Add a pinch of salt [21].
Place the olives on the focaccia [22], along with the oregano [23]. Leaven for an hour and a half, then bake in a static oven preheated to 480°F (250°C) for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your barese focaccia hot or warm [24].
