Focaccia is the snack par excellence throughout Puglia. Bari style focaccia can be enjoyed any time of the day: the city's bakeries prepare it nice and early and the aroma wafts throughout the streets. It is used to replace lunch or dinner, but it is also enjoyed whatever the time of day, as a snack or on the go, immersed in the feat of not staining their clothes with tomato, every bite of the way. Children take it to school, wrapped in parchment paper, as a break time snack. People take it with them to the beach, where it becomes the meal of a long day spent lounging under an umbrella at the seaside. It is also enjoyed as a meal during football matches, in the company of friends. From morning to night, focaccia is ubiquitous in the lives of Bari locals. It is difficult to describe every olfactory sensation conveyed by Bari style focaccia, the only way to understand is to walk into a Bari bakery and buy it fresh from the oven, or try the version by Antonio Fiore at home, which you'll find here below.
