Chestnuts: the autumn fruit par excellence! There are, in fact, over a hundred varieties of chestnut, ranging from the chestnuts to the sweet ones, and they feature heavily in many a sweet recipe, including the Mont Blanc and the simplest of cakes and creams hailing from various regional gastronomic traditions, such as the castagnaccio cake. Chestnuts are also very often eaten alone, roasted over a fire in a special perforated pan, or even baked in the oven, like in this recipe! Picture yourself sitting in front of a roaring fire, or tucked up at home on a rainy evening; there’s nothing better than a nice glass of red wine and the right company (even on Halloween) as you sit around peeling chestnuts that you’ve slowly roasted to perfection in the oven.
