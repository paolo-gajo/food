For best results, start by carving incisions into your chestnuts. Choose those that are perfectly intact and make a horizontal incision of around an inch (3 cm) in length [1]. Then pour them into a large bowl [2], pour in the water [3], and soak them for at least 2 hours. This process makes it easier to peel them once they’re cooked.
After the necessary time has elapsed, drain the chestnuts and, if you like, put them in a paper bag that will absorb any remaining water, or use a dry cloth to dry them thoroughly. Cook your chestnuts [4] by spreading them evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [5], and roast in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for around 25-30 minutes. Once they’re ready, take them out of the oven, place them in a basket or bowl, and cover them with a dry cloth [6]. Leave rest for at least 15 minutes before enjoying them, as this will make it easier to remove the skins!
