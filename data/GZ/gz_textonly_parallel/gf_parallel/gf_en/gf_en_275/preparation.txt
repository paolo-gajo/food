To prepare pasta alla vecchia bettola (old tavern pasta), first cut the tomatoes in half [1], chop the garlic [2] and cut the onion into small pieces [3].
Take a frying pan suitable for cooking in the oven (otherwise you will have to transfer the content into another pan later), and add oil, garlic, onion [4], oregano [5] and chili pepper [6]. Stir and fry for a few minutes over moderate heat.
Now blend with vodka [7] and let it evaporate completely, then add the tomatoes [8], salt, and pepper. Stir and cook for a few minutes over moderate heat [9]. At this point, bake in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for 45 minutes.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and put the pasta in just before the tomatoes are cooked, [10]. After the cooking time has elapsed, remove the pan from the oven [11] and transfer the seasoning into a tall, narrow glass, then reduce it to a cream with a hand blender [12].
Put the pan back on the stove, pour in the mixture obtained [13] and add the cream [14]. Stir and cook for a few minutes over moderate heat [15].
Drain the pasta al dente and transfer it directly into the pan with the sauce [16], stir and sauté briefly, then add grated Parmesan cheese [17] and stir again. Finally, plate and garnish with plenty of chopped parsley: pasta alla vecchia bettola (old tavern pasta) is ready to be enjoyed [18]!
