How do you imagine a classic tavern dish? Here is our answer: simple, abundant and incredibly appetizing, like pasta alla zozzona! Maybe that's exactly why pasta alla vecchia bettola (old tavern pasta) has earned its name, because it's one of those dishes that makes your mouth water just by smelling it! The creamy and velvety sauce brings to mind the recipe for penne pasta al baffo, but the protagonists in this case are fresh datterino tomatoes that are first blended with vodka and then roasted in the oven, to obtain a really rich and particular taste. Despite its appearance, pasta alla vecchia bettola (old tavern pasta) actually requires quite a long time to cook, but the result will be just as we imagined: simple, abundant and incredibly appetizing!
