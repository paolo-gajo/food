To make ham and cheese-filled veal rolls, first make sure that the slices are very thin [1], otherwise pound them with a meat tenderizer. Now stuff them with thinly sliced cheese [2] and ham [3].
Roll the meat [4] to make the roulade [5] and seal the ends with toothpicks [6].
Cook: Heat the olive oil with butter in a hot pan [7]. Toss in the aromatic herbs (thyme, rosemary and sage) collected in a bunch tied with kitchen twine [8]. Leave to release the flavors over medium heat for 3 minutes, then turn up the heat and add the rolls. Season with salt [9].
Add pepper too [10], brown them for 3 minutes on one side, then turn them and brown them for 1 minute on the other side [11]. Sweat with white wine [12] and let it evaporate.
Add the flour [13] and water [14] too. Lower the temperature, cover with the lid [15] and continue cooking for 6 minutes.
Once cooked, remove the herb bunch [16]. The rolls will be tender and wrapped in a creamy sauce [17]. Serve the ham and cheese-filled veal rolls hot [18].
