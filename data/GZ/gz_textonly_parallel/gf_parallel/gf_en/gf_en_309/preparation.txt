To make oat tarts with yogurt and fruit, make sure the dates are already pitted. Pour them into a mixer [1] and blend them until you get a cream [2]. Add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon [3],
add a pinch of salt [4] and honey [5]. Then mix everything with a spatula [6]
and add the oat flakes [7]. Mix everything until you get a homogeneous mixture [8]. Then equip yourself with a mini muffin pan and using a brush soaked in oil, grease each section [9].
Transfer a spoonful of the oat mixture inside the molds [10] and using the back of a small spoon, form baskets creating a cavity in the center [11]. Bake in a preheated conventional oven at 340°F (170°C) for 15 minutes. Take the baskets [12] out of the oven and let them cool
before removing them from the mold [13]. Transfer them to a tray [14] and stuff them with Greek yogurt [15]. If you like the yogurt creamier, make sure you mix it before placing it in the oat cup.
Decorate with mixed berries and a few mint leaves (16-17). Transfer to the refrigerator until ready to serve your oat tarts with yogurt and fruit [18].
