To prepare the egg cream, first place ice in a bowl and put it in the freezer so it is ready when needed. Then pour the Vin Santo wine into a saucepan [1], add half the sugar [2] and heat it just until it melts [3]. Do not heat the wine too much, otherwise the alcohol will evaporate; we recommend not to exceed 95째 F (35째 C).
Place the egg yolks in a bowl, and whisk in the remaining sugar [4]; continue whisking until you obtain a homogeneous mixture [5] then add a ladle of hot liqueur [6] to dilute the mixture.
Quickly add the remaining part of wine while whisking [7] and cook everything in a bain-marie [8], while continuing to whisk [9]. You will gradually notice a thickening of the cream, and the foam will tend to disappear.
Beat continuously until the volume has increased and the temperature has reached 180째 F (83째 C) [10]. If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, you will know that the egg cream is ready when the whisk leaves furrows and lines form. By lifting the whisk the egg cream will remain inside [11]. Take the bowl with ice from the freezer and place another one on top [12].
Pour the egg cream inside [13] and stir with a spatula gently for a couple of minutes [14]; it will cool quickly, the air will remain inside but that annoying film will not form. The egg cream is ready [15] to be served.
