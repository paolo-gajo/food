Making fresh pasta at home is an ancient art: from the dough rolled out with a rolling pin you can make golden wide noodles like tagliolini or tagliatelle, stuffed like ravioli or tortellini and timeless lasagna. Even today we are going back to trying our hand at fresh homemade pasta, a genuine product made with our own hands that is priceless! If you do the math, then, it doesn't take long to prepare a good fresh pasta: 15-20 minutes for a nice smooth and elastic dough, 30 minutes of rest, 15 minutes to roll out and make the dough... in about an hour you're done! We started from the classic proportion of 3/4 cup or 3.5 ounces (100 g) of flour to one egg, but a lot depends on what shape you want to prepare. So, one of the most valuable general tips is to keep a little of the amount aside and add as needed.
