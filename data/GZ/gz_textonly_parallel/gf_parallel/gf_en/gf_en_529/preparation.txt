To make this calamarata pasta with swordfish ragu, first wash the tomatoes, dry them, and cut them in half [1]. Heat the oil in a frying pan with a whole clove of garlic [2], then pour in the cherry tomatoes [3].
Season with salt [4] and pepper and stir to help the flavors develop, then add the capers [5], cover with a lid [6] and continue cooking for 20 minutes over low heat.
In the meantime, prepare the swordfish, cutting it into slices [7] if necessary, and removing the skin [8] and dicing it [9]. Heat a pan full of water, salted to taste, to cook the pasta in. 
In another pan, heat some oil with a whole clove of garlic [10], add the swordfish, and leave to brown slightly [11]. Deglaze with the white wine [12], 
remove the garlic clove [13], and season with salt and pepper [14]. The water should have come to a boil by now, so you can cook the pasta [15]. 
After 20 minutes, remove the garlic clove from the cherry tomatoes [16] and fish. Add the diced swordfish to the sauce [17], and as soon as the pasta is cooked, drain it and transfer to the pan [18]. 
Sauté everything for a few moments [19], add the chopped parsley [20], and stir again. Your calamarata pasta with swordfish ragu is ready to be dished up and served [21]!
