This calamarata pasta with swordfish ragu is a first-course dish with a real Mediterranean feel, prepared using a typical Neapolitan pasta variety called calamarata, whose name comes thanks to its similarity to the calamari rings it’s often dressed with. In the case of our recipe, the sauce is prepared using diced swordfish sautéed separately and fresh cherry tomatoes flavored with garlic and capers. This type of pasta is now very popular and readily available, but if you can’t find it, you can easily replace it with the paccheri or mezze maniche varieties.
