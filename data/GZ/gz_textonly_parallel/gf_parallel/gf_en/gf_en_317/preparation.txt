To prepare the Nutella cheesecake, start with the base. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over very low heat, then leave to cool. Meanwhile, pour the dry graham crackers into a food processor [1], then blitz to get a powder [2] and transfer to a bowl. Add the melted butter and leave to cool slightly [3].
Mix together well to get a sand-like consistency [4]. Butter a 9-inch (24-cm) cake pan and line with parchment paper. Pour in the graham cracker mixture [5] and use a spoon to compact it well and create the crust [6]. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for around 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, move on to your filling. Pour the cream cheese into a bowl [7] and add a tablespoon of Nutella [8], then mix well using a whisk or spatula [9].
At this point, add the rest of the Nutella [10] and continue to blend with the whisk [11] until you get a smooth cream. Take the cake pan from the refrigerator and pour the cheese and Nutella mixture over the now hardened crust [12].
Level the surface well with a spatula [13], cover with plastic wrap, and leave to firm up in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours (preferably overnight). Once this time has passed, transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate and decorate as you please with the chopped hazelnuts [14]. Serve your Nutella cheesecake nicely chilled [15]!
