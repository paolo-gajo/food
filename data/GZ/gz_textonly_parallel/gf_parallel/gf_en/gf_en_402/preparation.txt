To prepare the fusilli pasta with zucchini pesto and salmon, start with the zucchini pesto: Take the zucchini, cut off the ends [1], and grate coarsely [2]. Place the grated zucchini in a strainer over a deep container: The strainer must not touch the bottom of the bowl [3].
Lightly salt the zucchini [4], stir, and leave to drain with a weight on top [5]. A jar full of pulses or flour is ideal for this job. Let the zucchini stand like this for about 30 minutes so it loses its water [6].
Once drained, place the zucchini in a food processor [7], add the pine nuts, almonds, and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [8], followed by a pinch of salt [9],
oil [10], and the basil leaves [11]. Blitz until you get a uniform paste with all the ingredients well combined [12].
The zucchini pesto is ready: Transfer it to a bowl and set aside [13]. Next, place a pot full of plenty of salted water on the stove: You’ll need it to cook the pasta. Now turn your attention to the salmon steak, which should already be boned and skinned. First cut it into thick slices [14] and then cut those into strips about 1 inch (2-3 cm) long [15].
Transfer the strips to a bowl [16], add the oil [17], and season with salt and pepper [18].
Stir well to combine [19] and set aside. Once the pasta water has reached a boil, add the fusilli [20] and cook for the time stated on the package. Now go back to the salmon: First, juice one lemon [21].
Then add the salmon strips to a hot frying pan and sear for a few seconds, stirring as little as possible [22]. Deglaze with the lemon juice [23] and cook for a few more minutes [24]. Remove the pan from the heat and keep the salmon warm. 
Pour the zucchini pesto into a large saucepan [25]. By this time, the fusilli will have cooked: Drain and reserve some of the cooking water, then pour into the pesto [26], adding a ladleful of cooking water to blend everything together [27].
Mix the fusilli and pesto thoroughly [28], and add the salmon, stirring gently [29]. Heat the pasta through for a few seconds and then serve: Your fusilli pasta with zucchini pesto and salmon is ready to be enjoyed [30]!
