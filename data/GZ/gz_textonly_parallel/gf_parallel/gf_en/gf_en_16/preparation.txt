To prepare these yogurt cookies, start by placing the flour [1], salt [2] and baking powder for desserts [3] in a bowl.
Now add the sugar [4] and the egg [5]. Stir with a spatula [6]
and add the yogurt [7]. Stir some more, add the sunflower oil [8] and continue mixing the ingredients together. Add the seeds from one vanilla pod [9],
the lemon zest [10], and knead with your hands [11] to obtain a homogeneous dough [12].
Now take around 1 oz of dough [13], roll it out and join both tips to create a small donut [15].
Place the cookies onto a tray lined with parchment paper, a few inches apart from each other as they will grow in size when baked [16]. Bake in a static oven at 355°F (180°C) for around 22 minutes. Remove from the oven [17] and leave to cool before arranging them on a plate. Sprinkle with the icing sugar and serve [18].
