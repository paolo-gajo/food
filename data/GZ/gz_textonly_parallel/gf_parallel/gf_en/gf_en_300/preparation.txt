To prepare orecchiette, start by placing the remilled durum wheat semolina on a pastry board [1]; form a well [2] and add a pinch of salt to the flour [3].
Start pouring the water, which needs to be at room temperature, into the flour well [4]; gradually stir the flour [5] so that it absorbs the water as you continue to add it [6].
Knead by hand [7] to obtain a homogeneous and elastic consistency. This will take around ten minutes. Roll the dough into a ball [8], cover with a cloth [9] and leave to rest at room temperature for around 15 minutes.
Once the resting time is over, cut a piece of dough using a pastry wheel; leave the remaining pieces covered by the cloth. Shape the piece into a strip that is around 0.4 inches thick (10-11). Cut the strip into pieces that are around 0.4 inches in size [12].
Use a smooth bladed knife to form shell shapes, by placing each piece under the knife one by one and dragging towards you on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour [13]. Flip the shell over [14] to form your orecchiette. Repeat until all the dough is used up: you have made your orecchiette pugliesi [15]!
