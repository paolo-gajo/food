Orecchiette are the pride and joy of Italian cuisine, a fresh pasta shape made using remilled durum wheat flour, renowned and appreciated the world over as the gastronomic symbol of Puglia. Rigorously handmade, orecchiette are characterized by a typical round and concave shape, an unmistakable rough surface, with a thin middle and thicker edge. They are perfect served according to tradition, with turnip tops or in a simple tomato sauce, or with broccoli and sausage. In Puglia this particular type of fresh pasta goes by many names: 'recchie or recchietelle, because of their ear-like shape, 'chianchiarelle if small in size and 'pociacche if bigger. There is also a flat version of orecchiette, called strascinate, which are also stretched out on a pastry board using a knife, without being flipped over. What version has Chef Fabio Abbattista chosen for us?
