To prepare mayonnaise, place the yolks (from eggs at room temperature) in a deep bowl [1], add a few drops of lemon juice [2] and start lightly beat them with an electric whisk [3] on a medium speed, to give some body to the yolks.
Now gradually add the oil a little at a time and without rushing, so that you don't risk breaking the mayonnaise [4]. Add a little more, wait until incorporated, then gradually add some more [5]. During this step it is important not to add all the oil in one go, otherwise you could end up with broken mayonnaise. Once you have added around 40-50% of the total amount of seed oil, the consistency of your mixture will already be rather dense, so dilute it with the remaining lemon juice, once more adding a little at a time [6].
Finish adding the remaining oil, gradually and a little at a time [7]. Now that the mayonnaise is ready and whipped, add the salt [8], a pinch of pepper [9],
a teaspoon and a half of vinegar [10], and stir once more with the whisk for a few seconds, still on a medium setting [11]. Your mayonnaise is ready, delicately place it in a bowl and enjoy it however you like [12].
