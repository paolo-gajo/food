Mayonnaise is one of the most famous and widespread sauces in the world, but there is some dispute as to its origin. Two of the most accredited schools of thought on the matter go like this: the name mayonnaise derives from the Spanish city of Mahon, where the military cook of Armand de la Porte, Duke of Richelieu, improvised a sauce with raw oil and egg yolk, in 1757. However, according to the second version, the name mayonnaise comes from an ancient French word, Moyau, which means egg yolk: this sauce is nothing but an egg yolk and oil emulsion, after all.
