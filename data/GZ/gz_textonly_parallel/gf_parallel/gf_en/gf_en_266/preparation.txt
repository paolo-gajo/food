To prepare pasta with asparagus and sausage, place a saucepan with abundant water on the stove, bring to the boil and add salt: you'll need it for cooking the pasta in later. Start by cleaning the asparagus. Tip the stalk [1] and use a vegetable peeler to remove the outermost part [2]. Now cut into rather thick slices [3] and cut the tips in half.
Now prepare the sausage: use a knife to cut into the casing [4] and delicately remove it by hand [5]. Press the sausage down lightly on a cutting board [6], to crumble the inside. Leave to one side for now.
Remove the outermost leaves and tip the leek before finely slicing it [7]; place it in a large pan where you will have already heated the oil [8]. Leave to brown for 4-5 minutes, add a ladle of hot water and turn up the heat; add the sausage [9], stir continuously with a spatula or wooden spoon, until nice and brown.
Add the white wine, simmer, and when reduced [10], add the asparagus [11]. Stir, add salt and pepper to taste, then add a ladle of cooking water [12],
turn the heat down, cover with a lid [13] and cook for another 7-8 minutes. In the meantime you will have brought the water to the boil: cook the pasta [14], drain when firm to the bite and add it to the sauce straight away [15].
Add the grated cheese [16], stir [17] and serve your pasta with asparagus and sausage nice and hot [18]!
