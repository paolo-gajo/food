He is tall and slender, elegant and crisp. She is short, chubby and biting. A couple on a par with Laurel and Hardy, a love story to give Jessica and Roger Rabbit a run for their money. No, we're not playing Blind Date with Nikki Glaser, today we're pairing up two flavors born to be together, in a highly appetizing first course: pasta with asparagus and sausage! Sausages make a winning combination, whatever the season, from the coldest of times of the year, perfect paired with pumpkin, to the summer, when it features alongside eggplant! This recipe is perfect for when you want to start using spring ingredients, like asparagus, without turning your back on more succulent and wintry ones. Serve pasta with asparagus and sausage with a glass of white wine and you too can toast to this indivisible couple. Because once you find your soul mate, you'll never let them go!
