Apple cake is an authentic dessert thatâ€™s always been a firm favorite of ours and has inspired us to create other delicious variants such as an apple and chocolate cake, for those with a sweet tooth; a gluten-free blackberry cake; and even an eggless cake containing yogurt for those who prefer a lighter version. The latest exciting addition to this tasty list is this apple and orange cake, its name hinting at the citrusy aromas that will be released as it cooks, making for a deliciously aromatic cake. The distinct notes of orange offer a tasty new take on this soft apple cake that showcases the winter fruits at their best, so why not take breakfast and snack time up a gear with a slice of this delicious apple and orange cake!
