To make the apple and orange cake, first melt the butter over very low heat and set aside to cool. Wash and dry the apples thoroughly, then slice them in half and remove the cores [1]. Cut three of the four apples into thin, uneven slices without peeling them [2], then cut the fourth apple into more even slices, as these will be used for decoration later [3].
Season the uneven apple slices with the orange zest [4] and juice [5], stir, and set aside [6].
Pour the eggs into a bowl and whip them with an electric whisk, adding the cup (200 g) of sugar a little at a time [7]. Next, add the cooled melted butter [8] and Greek yogurt [9], continuing to stir as you do so,
to achieve a light, even mixture [10]. Now sift in the flour through a sieve [11], along with the baking powder [12], and stir gently with a spatula.
Add the orange-flavored apples to finish (13-14). Grease and flour an 8-inch (20-cm) cake pan [15] and pour in the mixture.
Spread it with the back of a spoon [16] to get an even surface [17]. At this point, take the apple slices that you set aside for decoration and arrange them side by side covering the whole cake [18].
Sprinkle the surface with granulated sugar [19] and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (175°C) for 70 minutes, until golden brown [20]. When it’s done baking, take the apple and orange cake out of the oven and serve sprinkled with powdered sugar to taste [21].
