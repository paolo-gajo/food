To prepare beef stew with peas, start by peeling and finely chopping the celery, carrot and onion. Now take the meat and cut it into 1-1/2-inch (2-3 cm) chunks, and place them in a bowl with flour [2]. Make sure they are well coated in flour [3],
and eliminate the excess flour by putting the pieces in a sieve. Now place a thick-bottomed pot on the stove. Heat some of the oil and add the pieces of meat [4]. Let them brown for a few minutes over a high flame, stirring frequently, to seal in the juices. As soon as the meat is well browned, sweat with the white wine and let the alcohol evaporate [5]. Lower the temperature a little and add the chopped aromatic herbs, letting them cook briefly [6].
Pour in the hot vegetable broth [7], then season with salt and pepper, and add the tomato paste [8]. Stir one last time and let everything simmer gently for about 85 minutes with the lid on. Occasionally stir to prevent the meat from sticking to the bottom and make sure the broth has not dried out too much. If it has, just add a little more broth [9].
At the end of cooking, remove the lid, add the peas [10] and cook for another 5 minutes. Your beef stew with peas is now ready to be served (11-12)!
