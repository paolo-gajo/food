To make polenta, heat a thick-bottomed steel saucepan, add 8.33 oz of water [1]; just before the water boils, add the salt [2] and then sprinkle in the flour, rapidly stirring all the while with a wooden spoon [3] (or using a special hazelnut wood stick called a tarello), at a high temperature.
Now add the olive oil, which will prevent lumps from forming [4]; continue stirring [5] and bring back to the boil before lowering the flame to a minimum. Cook for another 50 minutes on a low flame, stirring all the while and making sure it does not stick to the bottom. Once the 50 minutes are up the polenta is ready; set the flame to high so that it comes away from the sides of the pan [6], wait to see it detach from the bottom.
Now carefully flip the saucepan over onto a round cutting board, slightly bigger in diameter than the saucepan, to remove the polenta (7-8). Your polenta is ready to bring to the table [9]!
