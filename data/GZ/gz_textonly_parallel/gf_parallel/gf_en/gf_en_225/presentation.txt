An Italian abroad will miss pasta and coffee; a native of Lombardy will miss polenta. There are few dishes with such a strong identity and affective value, not just for the northern regions, but for people of the mountains from all over Italy. Polenta is a peasant yet delicious and substantial dish that has prevented hunger over the centuries with great dignity. Polenta, as in pulse or grain flour cooked in water, has very ancient origins, but it only became what it is today after the discovery of America, as corn, which gives it that sunny yellow color, came from the new continent. Polenta became a staple food, for the popular classes in particular, bringing to life a veritable "civilization of polenta". There are countless versions of this traditional dish: taragna, corn, buckwheat and Veneto style, the latter a white polenta. Polenta used to be cooked in a copper pan over the fire. Here we present you with a more modern version, so that you can still prepare an excellent polenta for serving with succulent meat stews, delicious sauteed mushrooms or creamy cheeses, to create nourishing and appetizing dishes like polenta with sausage and cheese or tasty dishes you can make using leftovers, like polenta and boiled salami timbale,?and even stylish gourmet temptations!
