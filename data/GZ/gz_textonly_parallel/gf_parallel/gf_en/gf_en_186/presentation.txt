Soft, fluffy, white ricotta cheese is one of the most popular cheeses used in cooking, especially when it comes to making desserts! Most of the time, in pastry-making, it’s used as a filling for cannoli or crostatas, but today we’ve decided to use it right in the batter to make a ricotta and chocolate cake. The result is a very thick mixture that turns into a soft, dense cake that’s perfect as a treat for breakfast or a snack! This tasty cake doesn’t require many ingredients, although make sure you don’t forget to add the chocolate pieces to make it even more tempting!
