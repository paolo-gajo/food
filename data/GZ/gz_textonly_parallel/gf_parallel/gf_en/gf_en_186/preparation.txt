To prepare the ricotta and chocolate cake, make sure your ricotta doesn’t have too much liquid; if it does, it will be best to leave it to drain for a while before starting. Then strain it and set aside. Also make sure that the ricotta, eggs, and milk are at room temperature before getting started, this way you won’t have any problems combining them. Now, separate the eggs (you’ll need to use ? cup (90 g) of whites and ¼ cup (60 g) of yolks), placing the whites and yolks in two separate bowls. Beat the whites until stiff using a hand mixer [1], and soon as you have a firm mixture [2], transfer it to the fridge if the room you’re working the ingredients in is fairly warm; otherwise, set them aside at room temperature. Next, melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat and allow to warm up. Then add the sugar to the egg yolks [3]
and mix using the hand mixer [4] until well whisked. When the mixture is light and whipped [5], turn down the speed and add the warm melted butter [6]; continue mixing with the mixer.
Once the butter has been absorbed, add the ricotta [7]. Mix at medium speed [8] until you have a smooth batter and the ricotta is well blended in [9].
Butter a 9-inch (22-cm) round cake pan that’s 2 inches (5 cm) high [10] and set aside. Then transfer the batter to a larger bowl [11] and add the egg whites as well [12].
Gently fold them in, working from the bottom upwards [13]. Once you have an even, airy mixture, sift the flour and baking powder [14] into the batter. Mix gently with a spatula, always stirring from the bottom upwards [15].
Next, add the room-temperature milk [16] and mix using a whisk [17] so that it gets absorbed completely [18].
Pour the mixture into the cake pan [19] and, using a spatula, spread it across the entire pan and then level the surface [20]. Roughly chop the dark chocolate [21]
and sprinkle it over the cake [22]. Then, using the back of a spoon, press the chocolate pieces [23] down gently to push them into the cake [24]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C), for around 30 minutes.
Always do the toothpick test, and once it comes out clean, it will be time to take the cake out of the oven [25]. Let it cool before turning it out of the pan [26]. Transfer the ricotta and chocolate cake to a serving dish and sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving [27].
