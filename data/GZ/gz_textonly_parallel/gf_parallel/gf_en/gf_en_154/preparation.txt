To make sausage risotto, first prepare the meat broth. Then clean and chop the shallot finely [1]. Cut the sausage and remove the casing [2], then flatten the meat with the back of the blade [3].
Move to the stove. Put a saucepan on the stove and drizzle in some oil. Let it warm up a few moments before adding the shallot [4]. Let it brown over medium-low heat, it will only take a few minutes. Then add the sausage [5] and let it brown for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the rice [6],
then toast and season, stirring [7], then simmer with white wine until reduced [8]. As soon as the alcohol has evaporated, start cooking the rice by periodically adding a ladle of hot broth [9]. Add it as soon as the previous ladle has been absorbed by the rice.
Then pour the saffron [10] and stir to mix [11]. When the rice is ready, remove it from the heat and stir, adding the butter and parmesan cheese [12].
Mix thoroughly [13]. Your sausage risotto is ready [14], so it is time to sit down and enjoy it [15]!
