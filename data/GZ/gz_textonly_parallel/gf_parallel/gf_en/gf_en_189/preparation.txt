Peel and thinly slice the onions [1]. Place them in a colander inside a bowl and sprinkle with two spoons of fine salt [2]. Mix thoroughly by hand and rub for ten minutes or so [3] to soften and draw out the moisture.
Now rinse thoroughly to remove the excess salt [4], drain the water and place in a bowl. Finely chop the parsley [5] and add to the onions [6].
Now add the flour [7], stir [8] and then add the water [9].
Thoroughly mix the ingredients together by hand [10] and add salt to taste [11]. Heat abundant oil to 340°F (170°C), then using two spoons add a few fritters at a time [12].
Fry the fritters for around 8 minutes, until nice and golden [13], then drain them one by one and place on a tray lined with kitchen paper to remove excess oil [14]. Serve your red onion fritters nice and hot [15].
