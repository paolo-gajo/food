With their extremely sweet flavor, high digestibility and color that never goes unnoticed, red Tropea onion is one of the products that characterizes the cuisine of Calabria. Braids of these onions hung ubiquitous throughout the alleyways of this town nestled on a cliff edge over the sea: you won't be able to resist buying one for yourself and as a souvenir for your friends. You can prepare them oven baked, use them as a condiment for a rich first course, or for an extremely simple recipe that exalts all their flavor: red onion fritters. A morish starter you can prepare in just a few minutes. All you'll need is water, a little flour and these special onions to sweeten your return from the holidays!
