Beef Wellington, a classic entr√©e both delicious and show-stopping, is ideal for impressing your guests during the holidays, like Christmas dinner. In our recipe, the beef tenderloin is coated with mustard, enriched with a chopped mixture of champignon mushrooms, and then wrapped in prosciutto. Puff pastry becomes a crispy, golden shell that makes the beef look incredibly succulent. You can decorate the dish using pastry scraps or by making incisions with a sharp knife, without piercing the pastry too much. Once cooked, it's very important to let the meat rest; this allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring you get perfect slices!
