To prepare the beef Wellington, first take the tenderloin and clean it from the most evident white parts using a sharp knife [1]. Salt it [2], pepper it, and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap [3].
Tighten the ends well and tie them [4], so as to give the fillet a round shape. Place it on a tray [5] and transfer it to the refrigerator to firm up for 2 hours. This step is to flavor the meat and maintain its shape. In the meantime, take care of the mushrooms: remove the base and any soil residues with a small knife [6].
Clean them with a damp cloth [7] and finely chop both the stems and the head [8] with a knife. Transfer them to a bowl [9].
 
Finely chop the parsley [10] and set it aside. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large skillet, add the mushrooms [11] and cook them for a few minutes, until all the water has evaporated. Then turn off the heat, season with salt, pepper, and add the parsley [12].
Set aside the cooked mushrooms and let them cool [13]. After two hours, remove the wrap from the fillet. Heat a swirl of oil in a large pan and as soon as it's hot, transfer the fillet inside [14]. Brown it well on all sides, turning it with tongs or two wooden spoons, being careful not to pierce it [15].
Remember to also seal the ends, placing the fillet vertically on the pan [16]. Then transfer it to a rack and let it cool down. Once it has cooled, brush the entire surface with mustard [18].
Lay out two or three sheets of plastic wrap on a flat surface and arrange the slices of ham slightly overlapping [19], to create a surface large enough to completely wrap the filet. Now spread the cooled mushrooms over the ham, forming a rectangle [20], and place the filet in the center [21].
Lifting the film, roll up the fillet [22]. Tighten the ends well, removing all the air, to give a uniform shape, creating a candy [23]. Set aside and meanwhile unroll the puff pastry on a surface and brush it with the previously beaten yolks [24].
Remove the film and place the fillet on the pastry [25] and roll it up, so as to completely wrap it [26]. Seal the edges well, letting out all the air inside [27]. Remove the excess dough and round the ends, pressing the dough with your hands.
Brush the surface again with the egg yolk [28]. Transfer to a baking tray and bake in a fan oven at 180°C (355°F) for 20 minutes, then increase the temperature to 190°C (375°F) and bake for another 10 minutes. We recommend using a probe thermometer to measure the internal temperature of the meat, as this is the only way to ensure the desired level of doneness. The ideal final temperature is between 52°C and 55°C (126°F and 131°F). Remove the fillet [29] from the oven and let it rest for about 30 minutes, allowing the juices to redistribute within the meat. At this point, slice [30] and serve your Wellington-style fillet!
