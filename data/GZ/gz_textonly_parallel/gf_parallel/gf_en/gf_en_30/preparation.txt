To prepare Venetian style cod, start by buying previously soaked dried cod, otherwise leave it to soak for 3 days in a bowl and change the water every day. Now remove the skin from the dried cod [1] and cut into slices [2]. Fill a saucepan with cold water and add the unpeeled garlic clove, 1-2 laurel leaves [3] and half a lemon.
Place the dried cod in the water, bring to the boil and leave to cook for around 30 minutes on a low flame [4]; skim the froth that will form on the  using a skewer [5]. The cooking time may vary according to the piece of dried cod you are using, so check that is well-done. Once the time is up, drain the dried cod and save the cooking water [6].
Place the dried cod in a bowl and check for any bones; leave it to cool [7], then place it in a planetary mixer bowl fitted with a whisk [8], or a leaf spatula. Switch on the planetary mixer at a low speed and gradually add the oil [9].
Once you have incorporated the oil, gradually add 6.76 tbsp of cooking water [10] and continue stirring to obtain a homogeneous cream with a spreadable consistency [11]. Add salt and pepper to taste, garnish with parsley and a drizzle of oil, then serve your puree of dried cod on slices of grilled polenta [12]!
