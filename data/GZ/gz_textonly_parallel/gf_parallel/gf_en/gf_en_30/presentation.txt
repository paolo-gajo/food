Dried cod often features in traditional dishes of Italian cuisine, prepared in different ways from region to region, for example dried cod Leghorn style or Ligurian style, not to mention the exquisite Venetian style cod. One basic thing sets this recipe apart from the previously mentioned ones: the main ingredient; just like in the Vicenza style version, the dried cod used to make the puree, is commonly called baccal√†, or salt cod, in Veneto! Now that we have cleared that up, we can focus on preparing this specialty, typically served as a starter on slices of grilled polenta. The important thing is that you soak the dried cod for the right amount of time, to guarantee a creamy consistency and delicate flavor. Perfect for the festive season, perhaps served in crisp tart pastry baskets, Venetian style cod is an excellent alternative to fritters, as a taster of the finest dishes our culture has to offer!
