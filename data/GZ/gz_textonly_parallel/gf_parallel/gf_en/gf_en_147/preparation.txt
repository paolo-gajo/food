To prepare sciatt, start by making the batter: be sure that all the liquid ingredients are thoroughly chilled, as recommended. Place the 00 and buckwheat flours in a bowl [1]. Stir with a whisk to mix both flours together, add salt [2] and pepper [3].
Stir some more to obtain a homogeneous mixture [4]; now add the beer [5] and almost all the water [6]. Save a little water so that you can tweak the consistency of the batter and add some more if necessary later on.
Now add the grappa [7] and stir with the whisk to obtain a smooth and fluid batter (8-9). A glossy surface is the best way of telling whether the batter is good. Place it in the freezer to keep it nice and cold.
Now prepare the baby chicory: wash the leaves and dab with a sheet of absorbent kitchen paper and cut into very thin strips [10]. Place the oil in a saucepan and heat to 340°F (170°C). In the meantime, prepare the Casera cheese: remove the crust [11] and cut it into 0.8-1 inch cubes [12].
Check the oil has reached the right temperature using a kitchen thermometer; remove the batter from the freezer and add the diced cheese [13]; stir it into the batter using two spoons [14]. Now use both spoons to remove a cube of cheese [15]
and without draining too much batter, place it in the oil [16]. Add another 4-5 cheese cubes [17] only, so that the temperature doesn't drop too much. Fry for around 50 seconds and turn them over occasionally so that they become golden all over [18].
Use a skimmer to drain the oil and place them on a tray lined with absorbent kitchen paper [19]. Continue until all the sciatt are fried. Make a quick salad to serve with your sciatt. Prepare a vinaigrette by placing the vinegar and a pinch of salt in a bowl [20] and stirring with a whisk [21].
Add the oil [22] and stir with the whisk to obtain a stable emulsion [23]. Finish with some pepper [24] and continue to stir.
Add the baby chicory and stir using two spoons [25]. Add some baby chicory to each plate [26] and arrange the sciatt over it [27]. Now serve, while still hot!
