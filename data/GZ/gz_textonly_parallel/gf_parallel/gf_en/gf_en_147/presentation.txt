SciattÂ is a typical specialty of Valtellina: crisp round fritters that conceal a flavorsome Casera heart, a typical local cheese. Just like another typical dish of Valetllina, pizzoccheri, sciatt are also made with buckwheat. Chef Roberto Valbuzzi, from Valtellina, brought the grains of this pseudowheat to the Giallozafferano kitchen to show us where the journey of this extraordinary ingredient begins, before it is turned into the flour used to make sciatt. In dialect, the name of these fritters means "toad": their bulgy and irregular shape means that they do bear a resemblance with this animal. The batter enveloping the cubes of Casera cheese is flavored with a small glass of grappa or spirit, watered down with a little sparkling water or beer. Discover how easy it is to make them... they are so delicious and flavorsome, they'll disappear in a flash!
