Fast and appetizing, pasta alla vesuviana (spicy pasta) is a first course with Mediterranean flavors, as its name suggests, and an explosion of taste with spicy notes that evokes the energy of the famous volcano that looks over the Gulf of Naples. Fusilli, penne or spaghetti, it doesn't matter: this dish is perfect for a quick meal and shows us that delicious and tasty dishes can be prepared in a short time! A fast sauce with intense flavors, it is the expression of a true and direct cuisine: that of the Neapolitan tradition. And if you want to immerse yourself completely in this combination of flavors, use Piennolo cherry tomatoes, a special variety that grows in the Vesuvian areas.
