To make the apple and ricotta fritters, first cut the apples in half [1], remove the core [2], and peel them. Then dice into cubes of around ?” (1 cm) [3].
Drain the ricotta well, then add it to a bowl along with the honey [4] and egg [5], and whisk together [6].
Now add the milk [7], sift in the baking powder [8], and add the flour [9].
Stir to mix these ingredients into the batter, then grate the lemon [10] and orange [11] peel into the mixture to add flavor. Add the diced apple [12]
and stir to mix the pieces into the batter. The batter is now ready for frying [13]. Heat the vegetable oil in a pot with tall sides. Once the oil has reached 265°F (130°C), immerse one spoonful of batter [14]. Cook just a few fritters at a time for around 8 minutes [15] and once they’ve turned golden,
drain them on a tray lined with paper towel [16] and allow to cool. To finish, dip them in the sugar [17] and serve the apple and ricotta fritters piping hot [18].
