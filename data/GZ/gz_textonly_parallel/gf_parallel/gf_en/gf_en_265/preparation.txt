To prepare the pasta with bell pepper sauce, boil the water for the pasta. In the meantime, wash the peperoni (bell peppers), remove the cap [1], cut them lengthwise, and discard the internal seeds [2], then dice them [3].
Coarsely chop the cluster tomatoes [4]. Pour a drizzle of oil into a saucepan and fry the unpeeled garlic [5]. Add the diced peperoni (bell peppers)
and the tomatoes [7], then season with pepper [8] and basil leaves [9]. Cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When the bell peppers are cooked, pour the pasta into the boiling water and cook it for the time indicated. In the meantime, pour the bell peppers and tomatoes into a tall container [11] and blend everything using a hand blender [12].
Transfer the sauce into a pan, or use the same pan in which you cooked the bell peppers [13], turn the heat to low, add a ladle of the water of the pasta, [14] and then, once the pasta is cooked al dente, drain, and add it directly into the peperoni (bell peppers) sauce [15].
Mix for a few moments to thoroughly coat the pasta [16], then transfer it to the serving dishes and season with a few more leaves of fresh basil [17]. Your pasta with bell pepper sauce is ready to be served [18].
