Colorful, fleshy, lively... Peperoni (bell peppers) are among the most versatile and popular summer vegetables to enjoy simply as a side dish or stuffed as a hearty meal. Today, however, we tossed them in the pot and then blended them to obtain a delicious sauce enriched with the color and flavor of cluster tomatoes. We chose a dish that would make the peppers the main protagonist, with the addition of only a few fresh basil leaves, but if you prefer, you can add a crunchy note with some pan-toasted breadcrumbs or almonds... Use your imagination to make this pasta with bell peppers sauce different and even better every time!
