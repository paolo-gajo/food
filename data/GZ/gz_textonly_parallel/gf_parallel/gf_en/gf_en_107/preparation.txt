To prepare the sponge cake, break the eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer [1], then take the vanilla bean, cut it in half and remove the seeds [2] with the blade of a smooth knife. Add them to the eggs [3]
with a pinch of salt [4]. Then turn the stand mixer on at medium speed [5] and mix for about 15-20 minutes, adding the sugar a little at a time [6] for it to be absorbed well.
In the meantime, carefully grease and flour the 9.5” (24 cm) cake mold [7] and as soon as the mixture of eggs and sugar has become clear, fluffed up and frothy [8], turn off the machine. As an alternative to a stand mixer, you can use an electric beater. To understand if the mixture is ready, lift out a part and “write” on the rest of the mixture. It should create a clearly distinguishable thread without being absorbed. At this point, place a fine sieve on the bowl of the mixer and pour both the flour [9]
and the potato starch [10] in the sieve. Sift the powders and mix everything with a hand whisk or a spatula making movements from the bottom up [11]. Do this step very gently so as not to deflate the mixture. As soon as the powders are completely incorporated [12],
pour everything into the cake mold [13] and use a spatula to level the surface [15]. At this point, it is essential not to beat the mold on the surface to level it, otherwise the mixture will deflate. Bake the sponge cake in a static oven preheated to 320°F (160°C) on the lowest rack for about 50 minutes. Avoid opening the oven during this time and before taking the cake out of the oven, check its readiness with the toothpick test since each oven is different. The toothpick must be completely dry when pulled out from the center of the cake. Once ready, take the sponge cake out of the oven [15].
Let the cake partially cool in the pan before removing it (16-17). Then let it cool completely on a wire rack before serving or filling it [18]!
