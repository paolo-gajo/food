Start by making this ingredient of your lemon pastry cream pie. Firstly, warm the milk in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in a large bowl, add the sugar [1] and beat quickly. Then pour in the juice of a lemon [2], beat again, and add the cornstarch [3]. 
Continue to beat with a whisk until the mixture is smooth [4]. As soon as the milk begins to boil, pour it slowly into the egg yolk mixture [5] and stir. Then pour the resulting mixture into the pan and return to the heat, stirring with a spatula [6]. 
Add the grated zest of 3 lemons [7] and continue to stir until the mixture has thickened [8]. If the mixture gets lumpy, remove the custard from the heat and stir vigorously with a spatula until the lumps have gone. As soon as the pastry cream is smooth, pour it into a baking dish [9] and cover it with plastic wrap in contact with the surface. Allow to cool, then place in the refrigerator to cool for at least two hours.
