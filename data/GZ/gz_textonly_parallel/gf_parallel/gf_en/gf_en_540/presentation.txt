"How do you tell how good bread is without tasting it? Not the smell, not the look, but the sound of the crust: a symphony of crackle." That's what Mademoiselle Tatou said in the Disney film Ratatouille and we imitated her in the kitchen of Giallozafferano: we prepared a fragrant bread with a crisp crust and a soft interior, with a thick honeycomb texture. The preparation of bread dough is a timeless recipe, magic that will take shape in your hands: water, flour and yeast to prepare a delicious loaf of bread baked in the oven at home, with all the necessary tricks to get a crackling crust! Early evidence of bread dates back to prehistory, when man realized that he could obtain a workable dough from ground acorns mixed with water. His wonder grew even more when he learned to bake this dough on hot stones, obtaining a harder but surely tastier product: the first attempt at baking bread. Of course, over time, the techniques for making bread dough have been refined, particularly in the more careful selection of ingredients.
