To prepare the bread dough first, start by dissolving the fresh brewer's yeast in water at room temperature [1]. Then pour both flour 00 and manitoba [2] into a large bowl and add 1 teaspoon of malt [3].  
Start mixing with one hand and with the other pour the water a little at a time [4], adding about half of it, and when it is completely absorbed add the salt [5]. Knead again [6] 
and add the rest of the water a little at a time [7] as you continue to knead. Once you have added the last part of water, continue kneading inside the bowl for about ten minutes [8], until the dough is nice and tight. If you prefer, you can do these steps using a mixer fitted with a hook, starting with a moderate speed and increasing it slightly at the end. Now let the dough rest for about ten minutes, no need to cover it [9]. 
After the dough has rested, transfer it to a lightly floured surface with the help of a blade [10]. Fold and unfold the dough as you knead it. Spread the dough with your hands [11], then fold two of the 4 outer edges towards the center [12]. 
Fold the other two flaps of dough towards the center [13] and turn the bread upside down [14]. Rotate the dough, swirling it with your hands on the worktop to give it a round shape [15]. 
Then transfer it to a lightly floured bowl [16], cover with plastic wrap [17] and leave to rise for about 2 hours or until it has doubled in size [18]. If the temperature is quite high, just leave it in the kitchen, away from drafts; in winter, instead, it is advisable to leave the dough to rise in the oven, turned off, with the light on. 
Now transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface [19] and repeat the same steps as before. Fold it [20], then turn it upside down and rotate it [21]. 
As soon as you have obtained a round shape, transfer it to a previously floured baking pan [22], cover with a damp cloth [23] and leave to rise for another hour. When it is well risen [24], heat the static oven to 480°F (250°C)
and make decorative slashes with a knife (25-26). Now reduce the temperature of the oven to 440°F (230°) and place a bowl full of water on the bottom, it will help provide the right amount of moisture. Place the bread on the central shelf and bake for 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350°F (180°C), take out the bowl of water and continue baking for another 35 minutes, simulating the open valve, i.e. slightly opening the oven door and inserting a pot holder to leave it ajar; this way the bread will be drier. Once out of the oven [27], let it cool down before slicing it!
