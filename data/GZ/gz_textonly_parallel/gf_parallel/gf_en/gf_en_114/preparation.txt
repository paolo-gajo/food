To make the spatzle, sift the flour into a bowl [1], add the eggs and some salt [2], and season with nutmeg [3].
Finally, pour in the room-temperature water (if you’re using a potato masher to make your spätzle instead of the special tool, be a little more conservative with the water to achieve a mixture that’s more robust and less fluid) [4], and whisk thoroughly to combine the ingredients and obtain a smooth, lump-free mixture that’s still pretty fluid [5]. In the meantime, bring a pot full of salted water to a boil. This will be used to cook the spätzle. Now, turn your attention to the seasoning, because the spätzle won’t take long to cook. Wash and chop the chive stalks [6].
Melt the butter in a large pan [7]. In the meantime, take the Spätzlehobel, the tool used to make spätzle, or if you don’t have one, a potato masher. Place the Spätzlehobel over the pan of boiling water, pour a ladleful of the mixture [8] into the designated space, slide the tool back and forth, and the newly formed spätzle will fall directly into the pan. Once they come into contact with the boiling water, the spätzle will cook in a few seconds [9], just like gnocchi.
When the spätzle begin to rise to the surface [10], drain them with a slotted spoon [11] and transfer directly to the pan you used to melt the butter [12].
Add the chopped chives [13] and, if too dry, add a ladleful of cooking water [14], stir to season, and serve your spatzle piping hot [15]!
