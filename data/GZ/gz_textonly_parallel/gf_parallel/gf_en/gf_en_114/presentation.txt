Spatzle are small noodles made of wheat flour, eggs, and water, a simple but tasty dish that’s very popular in the Tyrol region, its name indicative of its German origins. The characteristic teardrop shape of the spatzle is created using a special tool known as a Spatzlehobel – a kind of grater made up of a perforated base along which a container full of spatzle mixture is slid back and forth, causing the drops of liquid dough to fall directly into the boiling water before rising to the surface a few seconds later; an ingenious tool that makes it so easy to make these tasty little noodles. The secret to this dish lies in how you make it: just a few quick steps combined with ancient wisdom for guaranteed success! Once the spatzle are boiled, simply sauté them in a pan with a little butter and chives and what you’ll get is a truly appetizing first course, perfect for when you have lots of guests and need to achieve maximum output with minimum effort!
