Can simple ingredients combined together result in unique and tasty flavors? Yes, they definitely can, and the proof is spaghetti poveri (spaghetti with anchovies, olives and capers). A first course prepared with a quick sauce made with taggiasca olives, capers, chili pepper in which the anchovy fillets dissolve completely, creating a sauce with a distinct flavor. The spaghetti is saut√©ed briefly in a pan with the addition of breadcrumbs which give a pleasant crunchy note and absorb the sauce better. The result is a dish easy to prepare, very tasty and inviting: ideal for a quick lunch or dinner, for those who love lots of flavor and something delicious but there's little time to cook. You can choose to give an extra touch to your spaghetti poveri (spaghetti with anchovies, olives and capers) by adding cherry tomato or cubes of sun-dried tomatoes or, why not, you could turn them into a delicious spaghetti frittata!
