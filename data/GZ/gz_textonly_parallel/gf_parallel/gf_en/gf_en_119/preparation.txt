To prepare spaghetti poveri (spaghetti with anchovies, olives and capers), start by bringing a pot of salted water to a boil to cook the pasta in. Next, prepare the sautéed vegetables: finely chop the red onion [1] and the garlic clove [2]. In a large frying pan, pour the extra virgin olive oil until it almost covers the bottom and add the onion [3] and freshly chopped garlic.
Leave to fry for a few minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the sautéed vegetables from sticking to the bottom of the pan [4]. When the water has come to the boil, pour the pasta in and let it cook for the time indicated on the package [5]. Rinse the capers well under running water to remove excess salt and chop them coarsely [6].
Then add them to the sautéed vegetabmels [7], stir and add the anchovies [8]. Remove the seeds from the chili peppers, chop them coarsely [9],
and add them to the pan [10]. Leave to cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until the anchovies have dissolved. If necessary, thin the sauce with a ladle of pasta cooking water. Toast the breadcrumbs: take a pan, drizzle with oil and add the breadcrumbs [11]. Toast them by stirring until they are golden [12]. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl.
Go back to the seasoning, which will be ready by now: add the taggiasca olives [13], mince the parsley [14] and add it to the pan [15] stirring to mix well.
Drain the pasta al dente, saving some of the cooking water, and pour it into the pan with the sauce [16]. Stir and fry the spaghetti for a minute [17], then add the breadcrumbs [18].
Add a ladle of cooking water [19] and stir well [20] before serving [21]. Your spaghetti poveri (spaghetti with anchovies, olives and capers) is ready to be enjoyed!
