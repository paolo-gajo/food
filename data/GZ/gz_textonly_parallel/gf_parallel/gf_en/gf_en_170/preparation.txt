To prepare risotto alla pescatora, you must first clean the clams. First of all, make sure that all are well closed and discard any open ones. Beat them on a cutting board [1] and place them in a bowl with water and salt for a couple of hours [2]. Then drain them and cook them. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and let it warm, then add a crushed garlic clove and as soon as the oil is hot pour in the clams [3]. 
Raise the heat, wait a few seconds then sweat with the white wine [4]. Cover with a lid [5] and cook for a few minutes until they all open. Now, using a strainer, filter the cooking water in a bowl [6]. 
Discard the closed clams, shell the others and set them aside [7]. Now move on to the calamari (squid). Cut the tail in half [8], flatten it, lay it on a cutting board and cut it into very thin strips [9]. 
Set aside and proceed with the mullets. Cut the head and the final part of the tail [10], then fillet the fish to obtain 2 standard fillets [11]. Save the scraps because they will be used to make the broth. Now clean the shrimp. Detach the head, shell and tail with your hands [12] and set them aside, as they will also be used to flavor the broth. 
Then with a small knife cut the back of each shrimp [13] and remove the black vein. Next, make the broth. Finely chop the shallot [14] and cut the fennel into thin strips [15].
Pour a little oil into a large pot. Add 2 cloves of garlic, shallot, shrimp shells and mullet bones [16]. Let it brown [17], then add water with ice [18], 
fennel [19], peppercorns [20] and basil leaves [21]. 
Also add the previously filtered clam water [22]. Bring to a boil, then lower the temperature and cook for 15-18 minutes over low heat.Meanwhile, make the tomato coulis. Pour the tomatoes, sugar [23], salt, unpeeled garlic clove [24]
and the water [25] in a pan. Wait until it starts boiling, then cook for 5-6 minutes. Now remove the garlic [26], turn off the heat and transfer everything to a mixer. Blend all ingredients and transfer to a bowl [27]. Now the broth will be ready too, so filter it and keep it warm. Proceed to cook the rice. 
Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the chopped shallot [28] and let it toast slightly. When it starts to sweat, add the Carnaroli rice [29] and let it toast while stirring occasionally [30].                                        
To know when the rice is well toasted, touch it with the back of your hand, without scalding yourself, and if it is hot add the white wine [31], about 1/4 cup (40 g). As soon as it has evaporated, wet the rice with a couple of ladles of broth [32] [33].
As soon as it starts to boil, it will take about 13 minutes to cook, you will have to add more broth only when needed.After about ten minutes, the rice will be almost cooked, add the clams [34] and stir. Then add the squid [35], stir again, add the shrimps and stir again [36]. 
Wait 13 minutes, then remove from the heat and stir. Add the oil, the thinly sliced chili pepper, a little white pepper and some basil leaves [37], breaking them up with your hands. Add the tomato coulis [38], shake the pan at the same time to mix [39].
Cover with a lid [40], let it rest for a minute and in the meantime quickly sear the mullets. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, let it warm, then add the mullet fillets [41]. After a few seconds turn them over and finish cooking on the other side [42]. 
Then transfer them to a tray with absorbent paper to dry them [43]. Back to the rice now, taste it. Adjust the salt, white pepper and, if necessary, add a little more oil [44]. Stir it one last time before serving. Pour a ladleful of rice in the middle of a plate [45].
Tap with the palm of your hand under the bottom of the plate to distribute the rice evenly. Place three mullet fillets on top of each portion [46] and finish off with a sprinkle of parsley oil [47]. Serve risotto alla pescatora still hot [48]!
