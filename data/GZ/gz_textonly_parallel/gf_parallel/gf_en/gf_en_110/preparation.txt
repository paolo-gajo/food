To prepare spinach patties, start by cooking the spinach. Heat the oil and the garlic [1] in a capacious pan, gradually add the spinach [2] and put the lid on to sweat them [3].
When the spinach is cooked, remove the garlic [4] and place them in a sieve to drain the water [5]. When they cool down, drain and finely chop them with a knife [6].
In the meantime, dice the old bread [7], place in a bowl and add the milk [8] to soften it: this will take around 10 minutes, depending on how hard the bread is. Stir the bread in by hand, to amalgamate it well [9].
Place the spinach in a capacious bowl, along with the softened bread [10] and the grated cheese [11]; flavor with the grated nutmeg [12].
Add the thyme leaves [13], the egg [14] and salt to taste. Stir by hand [15] to amalgamate the mixture.
Now add the breadcrumbs too, adjust the amounts used according to the consistency of the dough [16]. Stir once more [17], cover with plastic wrap [18] and leave to rest in the refrigerator for around 30 minutes.
Once the 30 minutes are up, take the dough and shape 9 cutlets by hand, each around 3 oz (85 g) [19], then place them on a tray lined with parchment paper [20]. Leave to harden in the refrigerator for another 30 minutes. Beat the eggs with a little salt. Once the hardening time is up for the patties, dip them in the egg [21].
Now dip them in the breadcrumbs [22] and repeat for each pattie [23]. Fry them in the hot oil at around 340°F (170°C) for around 4-5 minutes [24].
When golden [25], drain them onto a tray with absorbent kitchen paper [26] and serve them nice and hot [27].
