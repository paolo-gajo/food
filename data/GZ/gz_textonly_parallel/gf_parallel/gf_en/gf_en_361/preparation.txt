To prepare lemon scalloppini, start by squeezing the fruit to obtain the juice [1]. Then cover the meat with parchment paper, so as not to tear the fibers [2], and beat using a tenderizer. Strike firmly but not too hard, to tenderize the tissues without tearing the pulp [3].
Coat the sliced veal in flour [4], remove any excess flour, then melt the butter on a low flame in a capacious pan and add the sliced veal. Turn up the flame and brown for a couple of minutes on one side [5] and then on the other [6].
Add salt and black pepper to taste [7], then add the lemon juice to the pan and cook on a low flame for 2-3 minutes [8]. As soon as the sauce thickens and becomes creamy, remove from the flame and serve the lemon scalloppini immediately [9]!
