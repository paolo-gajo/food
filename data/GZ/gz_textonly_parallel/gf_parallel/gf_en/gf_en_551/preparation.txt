To prepare the filet with porcini and truffle, thoroughly clean the porcini mushrooms, then slice them horizontally [1]. In a non-stick skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and saut√© two crushed garlic cloves until golden [2], then add the porcini mushrooms and cook them over medium heat for 7-8 minutes [3].
Season with salt and pepper [4]; as soon as the mushrooms have softened, add the chopped parsley [5], mix well, and turn off the heat. Finally, grate a few truffle shavings [6],
cover everything with a lid and set it aside [7]. Now, focus on the meat: tie kitchen twine around each beef fillet to maintain its shape during cooking [8], then drizzle a bit of oil into a non-stick skillet [9],
where you'll sear the meat [10]. The fillets should cook for about 5 minutes on each side over high heat (use tongs or a fork to turn them) [11]. Season the fillets with a pinch of salt around halfway through cooking. When the meat is done, garnish with a sprinkle of truffle [12].
Now that the fillets are ready [13], start plating: take a serving platter and place some pre-washed and trimmed watercress on it, then lay the fillets on top and arrange the porcini mushrooms on the side [14]. Finish it all with a generous grating of truffle [15]: your fillet with porcini and truffle is ready to be served at the table!
