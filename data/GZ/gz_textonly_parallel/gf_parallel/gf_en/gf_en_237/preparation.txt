To prepare pistachio cream, place the sugar, corn starch [1], salt (optional) [2] and eggs [3] in a saucepan. 
Now add the pistachio paste [4] and a little of the milk, at room temperature. Stir vigorously with a whisk, until smooth [6]. Now add the remaining milk
and heat the mixture up [7]. Stir continuously for a few minutes until the cream thickens [8]. Now place the cream in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap [9] and leave to cool.
