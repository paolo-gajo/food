Today we'd like to present you with an original and delicious idea, perfect for serving as an appetizer with drinks; just like us, you'll fall in love with the fragrant and lightly crispy base of our potato tart! A savory tart that doesn't require you to make any dough, something anyone can make...no shortcrust or puff pastry in sight, just a simple potato julienne flavored with thyme. The potatoes will bind together to form an impeccably compact base, for effortlessly clean-cut slices once cooked, with a consistency very similar to that of a rosti. Do you know what the best thing is? You can fill it with whatever you love most...cheeses, cold cuts, or vegetables can all be used to make the perfect filling for this potato tart. Fasten your apron and let your imagination run wild!
