To prepare the potato tart start by washing and peeling the potatoes [1]. Grate them using a grater with large holes [2] and place them inside a colander over a bowl [3].
Gently wring them out by lightly pressing with a spatula, to eliminate excess water [4]. To dry the potatoes even more, spread them on clean cloth using a fork [5]. Cover with another cloth and dab them until completely dry [6]. In the meantime preheat a static oven to 360°F (182°C).
Place the potatoes in a bowl [7] and season with salt [8] and pepper [9].
Now add the fresh cream [10], the thyme leaves [11] and the egg [12].
Stir all the ingredients together thoroughly [13]. Butter an 8" (22 cm) mold with an extractable bottom and coat in breadcrumbs [14]. Pour the mixture into the mold [15]
and spread it over the entire surface with a fork, delicately pressing down on the sides (16-17). Bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C). for around 35 minutes, until the sides are nicely golden [18].
Remove your base from the oven and fill with the sliced cheese [19], prosciutto cotto [20] and gorgonzola cheese. For the latter, simply spread it over the tart using a spoon [21].
Now [22] place the tart back in the oven, once more at 355°F (180°C), for another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven [23] as soon as the cheese melts, remove from the mold and enjoy your potato tart [24].
