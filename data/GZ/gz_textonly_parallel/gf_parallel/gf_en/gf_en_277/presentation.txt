The aromas and flavors of Sicily, a magical, magnetic island that’s sunny and beautiful from north to south and east to west. And it’s precisely from the eastern part where this recipe has its origins: pasta alla Norma. This dish is one of the symbols of Sicilian cuisine, a specialty from Catania created as a culinary tribute to one of the most beautiful operas by the celebrated composer and Catania native Vincenzo Bellini: Norma. A tasty first course pasta dish served with a fresh tomato sauce and fried eggplant, traditionally cut into slices. But it wouldn’t be pasta alla Norma without the addition of a clove of garlic, fresh basil leaves, and, of course, a generous grating of salted ewe’s milk ricotta – Sicilian, obviously – added directly to the plates. Melina, the owner of the family-run trattoria U Fucularu in Cantina, together with her daughter Alessia, shows us and explains the simple secrets to this extraordinary dish that she’s been making in her restaurant for decades, like she would for her family!
