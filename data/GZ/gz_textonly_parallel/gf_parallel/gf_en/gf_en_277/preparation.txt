To make pasta alla Norma, first wash and dry the eggplant well, and trim it [1]. Cut it into slices around .30 inch (8 mm) [2] and transfer to a colander [3].
Sprinkle with salt [4] and leave to drain for at least 15 minutes. In the meantime, turn to the tomatoes: Wash them and remove the stems [5]. Cut in half [6].
Place in a pot with a pinch of salt [7], 3 cloves of garlic (you can use fewer if you prefer, but the garlic characterizes pasta alla Norma) [8], and a handful of basil [9].
Let this cook over low heat for 30 minutes without adding anything else; the tomatoes will release their liquid [10]. After 30 minutes, remove the garlic and basil [11]. Transfer the tomatoes to a food mill fitted with the finest disc and grind them [12].
Once you’ve got your purée [13], transfer it to a pot, add another clove of garlic [14] and a sprig of basil [15]. Let it cook for another 40 minutes, stirring every once in a while. 
At this point, you can rinse the eggplant well, drying it with paper towel. Next, pour the extra virgin olive oil in a deep pot and bring it to a temperature of around 340-350°F (170-180°C). Immerse a few slices of eggplant at a time in the oil [16] and turn them every now and then. It will take a few minutes for them to turn nicely golden [17]. At this point, remove the eggplant from the pot with kitchen tweezers and transfer to a tray lined with paper towel [18]. Continue frying the eggplant, and in the meantime, put a pot full of water on the stove, which you’ll use to cook the pasta. 
Once the sauce is fairly thick, remove the basil [19], add a spoonful of the oil the eggplant was cooked [20] in and a drizzle of fresh olive oil [21].
Cook the pasta until it’s al dente [22], drain, and pour into the sauce [23]. Flip the pan quickly to cover the pasta with the sauce [24].
Transfer the pasta to the plates, add the fried eggplant [25], plenty of grated ricotta salata [26], a basil leaf, and then your pasta alla Norma is ready to be served [27]!
