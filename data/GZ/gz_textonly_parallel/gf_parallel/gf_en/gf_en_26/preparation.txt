To prepare the lemon and white chocolate pound cake, first make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature of 75° F (24-25° C). Grate the lemon rind and squeez out the juice, then cut the chocolate into cubes [1]. In a large mixer equipped with blades, pour in the eggs, sugar, lemon juice [2], salt [3],
baking powder [4], grated lemon rind [5], white chocolate cut into cubes [6],
butter [7], flour [8] and honey [9]. 
Run the blades at maximum speed and mix everything for 2 and a half minutes until a smooth mixture is obtained [10]. Butter and flour two 6x3-inch (16x8 cm) pans and transfer the dough inside, dividing it equally [11]. Now dip a knife in melted butter [12],
insert it in the center of the pound cake [13], move it gently and pull it out to create a cut. Do the same for the other. In this way it will rise evenly as it bakes. Bake the pound cakes in a static oven at 365° F (185° C) for 15 minutes, then at 330° F (165° C) for 30 minutes. Remove and let cool [14]. In the meantime, prepare the lemon syrup. Pour the water and sugar [15] into a saucepan.
Add the lemon zest with a knife [16] and bring to a boil [17]. In another bowl, pour the lemon juice [18].
When the syrup begins to boil, pour it unfiltered on the lemon juice while hot [19]. Now make the icing. In another bowl pour the powdered sugar, water [20] and stir with a whisk until all the lumps dissolve [21]. The mix should be rather watery.  
Pour the jam into a saucepan and bring it to a boil [22]. Remove the pound cakes [23] and put them on a rack placed on a baking tray. Using a brush, brush the surface and the sides with lemon syrup [24]. 
Brush the pound cakes with jam [25] and then with the icing [26], covering the sides and the surface [27].
Transfer the cake back into the oven at 450° F (250° C) for 5 minutes until it is dry. Once baked, it should not be sticky when touched [28]. Decorate to taste with candied citrus peel if desired [29], then serve your lemon and white chocolate and lemon pound cake [30].
