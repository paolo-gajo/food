Lemon pound cake is a simple but special dessert that is always appreciated by all. Together with Maestro Iginio Massari, we will show you how to turn it into a masterpiece of pastry making, with a few simple tricks. Lemon and white chocolate pound cake will be perfect for breakfast, a snack, or served as a dessert at the end of dinner. Making the dough is very simple: just blend all the ingredients together at the right temperature. The lemon juice will be completely absorbed, and its scent will spread through the air, slice after slice. The icing allows you to obtain a shiny cake, but at the same time serves to make it impermeable, so it remains soft for a long time. However, we are quite sure that you will not be able to test this out since the lemon and white chocolate pound cake will not be around long enough!
