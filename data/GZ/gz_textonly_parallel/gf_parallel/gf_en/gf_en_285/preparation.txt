To prepare pappardelle pasta with shrimps and asparagus, start by cleaning the asparagus: cut off the bottom and peel the lighter colored and tougher part [1]. Boil the asparagus whole in a special asparagus pot for 5-10 minutes [2], with the tips out of the water [3]. Don't cook for too long as overcooked asparagus loses its consistency; the cooking time depends on the size of the asparagus.
Remove the asparagus from the pot and cut half of the stalks into slices [4]; leave the tips to one side. Use the remaining half of the asparagus to create a sauce: blend in a mixer with a ladle of cooking water [5], to make a creamy mixture [6].
In the meantime, finely chop the onion [7], dissolve 2 tablespoons of butter in a non-stick pan [8], add the finely chopped onion [9] and leave to brown for around 3 minutes on a medium flame. In the meantime, bring a saucepan filled with water to the boil, for cooking the pasta.
Add the peeled shrimp tails [10], cook for a few minutes and add the white wine [11]. Simmer, reduce and then add the sliced asparagus [12].
Incorporate the sauce [13] and the cream [14], salt, pepper to taste and cook on a moderate flame. In the meantime, cook the pasta for around 4 minutes, or for as long as it says on the packet [15].
Drain the pasta [16] and save the cooking water. Add the pappardelle pasta to the sauce [17], followed by the asparagus tips you left to one side [18]; saut√© for a few moments and add some cooking water if necessary.
To finish, flavor with the finely chopped chives [19]. Your pappardelle pasta with asparagus and shrimps is ready [20]: serve nice and hot [21].
