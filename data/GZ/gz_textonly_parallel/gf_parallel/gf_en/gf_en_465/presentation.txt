Everyone always likes popsicles! Not long ago, for the little ones we prepared yogurt and berries popsicles for a fresh and healthy snack... and today we offer you coffee and cream popsicles that contains a unique aroma and a special sweetness to be discovered. The variegation of cream and coffee hides a secret inside: crunchy pieces of chocolate, but since the gluttony never ends we have chosen to decorate them, "dirtying" them even with chocolate on the outside. If you really want to overdo it, try dipping them halfway in chocolate like we did for the avocado popsicles!
