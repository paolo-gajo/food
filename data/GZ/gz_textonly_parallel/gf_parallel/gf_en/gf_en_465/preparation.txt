To prepare coffee and cream popsicles, first prepare the coffee with a mocha and let it cool. Then pour the cream in a bowl [1], add the honey [2] and whip half way through [3].
You will need to stop when the cream is already a little thick, but not yet fully whipped [4]. At this point divide the mixture into two bowls, pouring about 250 g into one and about 450 g into the other [5]. Pour the cold coffee into the latter [6]
and mix (7-8). Make some chocolate chips using a potato peeler [9].
Equip yourself with a mold for popsicles and insert a little coffee cream inside each section [10]; then add the chocolate chips [11] and continue adding a little white cream [12].
Continue alternating the two types of cream [13] until the mold is completely filled. Insert the wooden sticks [14] and place in the freezer for at least 4 hours. After this time, take the mold of the freezer again, wetting the outside of the mold [15]
remove the popsicles gently, place them on a tray and place them in the freezer [16]. When serving, coarsely chop the chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie (or in the microwave) [17]. Then use it to decorate any coffe and cream popsicles, wait a few seconds for it to solidify and serve [18]!
