Risotto is one of those dishes that is perfect for every occasion. Without a doubt saffronÂ risotto is the most classic example, typically served with marrowbones in Lombardy, but there are truly countless ways of preparing a good risotto! Today we present carrot risotto, a delicate yet flavorsome recipe! The sweetness of carrots is exalted by the flavor of the cheese used for creaming the risotto. For a decisive note we chose a typical Northern Italian cheese: taleggio. Thanks to this cheese, the risotto will be much creamier, with a truly special taste! A match made in heaven, for a unique dish, suitable for any occasion!
