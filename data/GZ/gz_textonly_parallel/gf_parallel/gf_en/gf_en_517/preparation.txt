To prepare carrot risotto, start by making the vegetable broth. When ready, keep it hot and peel the carrots [1]. Cut them into sticks [2] and then into pieces, each around 0.4 inches (1 cm) in size [3].
Peel and finely slice the spring onion [4]. Melt the butter in a saucepan [5], add the spring onion [6]
and the carrots [7]. Add a ladle of vegetable broth [8] and leave to sweat for around ten minutes; add more squash if necessary. One the time is up, remove a spoon of the cooked vegetables [9]
and place in the mixer glass, along with a ladle of vegetable broth [10] and leave to one side. Place the rice in the saucepan with the cooked vegetables [11] and stir to toast it [12].
Continue adding broth when necessary, until the rice is fully cooked [13]. In the meantime, remove the crust from the taleggio cheese [14] and dice it [15];
Blend the cooked vegetables you left to one side with an immersion mixer [16]. When the rice is nearly done, add the cream [17], add salt to taste and stir [18].
Once cooked, remove the saucepan from the stove, add the diced cheese [19] and stir [20]. Put the lid on and wait 1-2 minutes [21],
then add the black pepper [22] and thyme leaves [23]. Stir one last time and serve your carrot risotto nice and hot [24].
