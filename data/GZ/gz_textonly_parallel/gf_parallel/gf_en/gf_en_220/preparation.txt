To make the potato and gorgonzola tart, start by boiling the potatoes [1] until soft (this will take around 30-40 minutes). Prepare the shortcrust pastry in the meantime: place the pieces of butter at room temperature and the grated Grana Padano PDO cheese in a bowl [2]. Knead rapidly by hand [3].
Now add the eggs [4], a pinch of salt and lastly, the flour [5]. Knead by hand to incorporate all the ingredients [6].
Now place the dough on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour [7] and shape into a smooth and homogeneous piece [8]. Wrap it in plastic wrap [9] and leave to rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
In the meantime, peel the potatoes, place them in a bowl and mash them to make a puree [11]; now flavor with the grated cheese [12]
and the salt [13]. Stir to amalgamate and leave to one side. Take the shortcrust dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour, until around 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) thick [14]. Wrap the shortcrust dough around the rolling pin [15].
Unroll the dough onto a 9.5 inch (24 cm) diameter tray [16]. Define the edge by running a knife along it and removing any excess dough. Pierce the bottom with the prongs of a fork [18].
Fill with the potatoes [19] and the gorgonzola cheese [20]. Roll out the left over shortcrust dough and cut into strips that are around 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) wide [21].
Arrange the pastry strips on the tart so that they overlap, to create a lozenge pattern [22]. Cut away any excess dough. Use the remaining shortcrust dough to form a strip the same length as the circumference of the mold [23]. Position it along the edge and press down with the prongs of a fork to make sure it adheres to the tart, while also creating a decorative pattern [24].
The tart is ready to be baked [25]. Bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 45 minutes. Once baked, remove the potato and gorgonzola tart from the oven [26] and serve warm [27].
