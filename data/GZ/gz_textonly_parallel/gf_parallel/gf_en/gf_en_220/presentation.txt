They can be sweet, like jam ones, ideal for breakfast and as a snack, or savory, like the one with ricotta cheese and zucchini, perfect with drinks or for dinner buffets. We love searching for tantalizing pairings and here we present you with this recipe for a potato and gorgonzola tart, a starter with an irresistible creamy filling, created for lovers of unique and distinctly flavored cheeses.
