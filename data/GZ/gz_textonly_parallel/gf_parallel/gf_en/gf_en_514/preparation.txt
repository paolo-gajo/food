To make cavatelli pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe, start by preparing the broccoli rabes: clean them by removing the leaves from the stalk using a knife [1] and rinse under running water [2]. Coarsely chop the soft inside of some fresh bread [3],
place in a mixer [4] and finely blend [5]. Remove the casing from the sausage and crumble the meat, then roll it into small balls by hand [6]
and brown on a medium to high flame in a hot pan for around 10 minutes (7-8). Now place it in a dish [9], cover with wrap so that it stays warm, and continue preparing the recipe. Leave the saucepan with the baking sauce to one side, ready for use later on.
Place a saucepan filled with water on the stove and add salt when it comes to the boil, for cooking the pasta. Finely chop the fresh peperoncino [10] and place it in a saucepan with oil [11], add the finely chopped bread [12]
and saute in a pan, stirring occasionally, until golden [13]. Save some soft bread for garnishing the dish. In the meantime, brown 2 peeled whole garlic cloves in the same pan used for the sausage, with oil [14], then add the broccoli rabes [15]; press them down so that they all fit in the pan; as they start to cook they will reduce in volume.
Cook the broccoli rabes for around 10 minutes, once cooked remove the garlic cloves [16] and add the small sausage pieces kept to one side [17], then add salt to taste. In the meantime, boil the fresh cavatelli pasta for 5 minutes [18];
drain, add to the condiment [19] and stir for a few minutes until creamy. Garnish each plate with some toasted bread pieces [20] and serve your cavatelli pasta with sausage and broccoli rabes right away [21]!
