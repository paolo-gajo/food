The boundless variety of Italian products also includes fruits and vegetables and how they are identified up and down the country.Â Broccoli rabes are an example, which in some areas are known as broccoletti; in Naples, the smaller and tender tips of a local variety are called friarielli, or spigatelli, also referred to as alla molisana. Inspiration for today's dish comes straight from this small yet mighty Italian region: cavatelli pasta with sausages and broccoli rabe. A delicious and quick first course featuring the pairing of these greens with sausage, for a delicious result, made even more special by the toasted soft bread. A first course that invites us to savor it through its aroma and presentation, winning us over immediately after just one bite. Lovers of the timeless pairing orecchiette pasta with turnip greens, or broccoli and sausage, make room for cavatelli pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe: they're bound to be a hit on your menu!
