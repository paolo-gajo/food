The cornerstones of Roman cuisine: creamy carbonara, flavorful amatriciana, and authentic cacio e pepe. No visit to the capital is complete without tasting these delicacies from the working class culinary tradition, which have since become classic gourmet dishes, along with many other typical recipes such as artichokes and saltimbocca (veal cutlets). There is a dish that combines all the best of the three first course recipes: Pasta alla zozzona (carbonara, amatriciana and cacio e pepe pasta). Some of you may not have heard of it: we only just discovered it and immediately fell in love! Pecorino Romano cheese, egg yolks, guanciale, sausage, and cherry tomatoes are the dearest ingredients to the culinary tradition of Lazio. Mixed together, they create a robust and enjoyable dish, "zozzo" ("dirty") in the sense that it is extremely rich and decidedly distant from the concept of light food. Pasta alla zozzona is a feast for the palate, the truest celebration of the Roman style at the table, an amazing recipe for those who love strong flavors and substantial dishes!
