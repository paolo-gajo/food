To make cinnamon rolls with liquid sordough starter, place the water [1], milk [2] and brown sugar in a planetary mixer bowl [3].
Add the cinnamon [4], switch on the planetary mixer and stir all the ingredients together, before adding the liquid sordough starter [5] and the brewer's yeast [6].
Add the flours [7] and mix at a medium speed once more. Lastly, add the salt [8] and mix to obtain a homogeneous dough [9]. Leave to rest in the bowl for 30 minutes, without covering it.
Once the time is up, add half of the softened butter [10], then the other half [11] and continue to blend with the planetary mixer at a medium and then at a fast speed. Once the butter is thoroughly incorporated [12], leave the mixture to rest for an hour, at room temperature.
After an hour, place the dough on a worktop, slap and fold it to reinforce it and make it more compact [13]. When the dough becomes nicely smooth and taut [14], place it in a bowl greased with some oil, cover with plastic wrap and leave to leaven in the refrigerator for around 10-12 hours [15].
Prepare the filling just before the dough fully leavens: place the softened butter and demerara sugar [16] in a bowl, add the cinnamon [17] and stir with a spatula to thoroughly incorporate the ingredients [18].
Now take the dough and start opening it out with your hands [19], then sprinkle with a little flour and roll it out with a rolling pin [20] to form a 13x15 inch rectangle [21].
Spread two thirds of the filling over the entire surface of the rectangle [22], then tightly roll it along the longer side [23]. Wrap the roll in the parchment paper [24] and leave to firm up in the refrigerator on a tray, for an hour.
Once this time is up, cut the roll into 12 pieces of equal width [25]. Place the rolls on a tray lined with parchment paper [26] and leave to rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Once leavened [27], bake the cinnamon rolls in a ventilated oven at 400?F for 20 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the glaze: place the remaining filling in a saucepan [28], add the cream [29] and bring to the boil, stirring thoroughly all the while to make sure the sugar dissolves [30].
When the cinnamon rolls are ready, remove them from the oven and leave them to cool [31], then brush abundant glaze over them [32]. Your cinnamon rolls are ready to be enjoyed [33]!
