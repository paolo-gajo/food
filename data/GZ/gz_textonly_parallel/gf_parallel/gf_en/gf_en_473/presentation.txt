All-famous cinnamon rolls become even more irresistible thanks to the recipe for cinnamon rolls with liquid sordough starter, prepared for us by chef Stefano Ferraro! The version with liquid sordough starter, compared to the one with brewer's yeast alone, undoubtedly requires more patience, as the dough must slowly and gradually leaven, but it will be worth the extra effort: not only will your cinnamon rolls have a unique aroma and texture, they will also be more digestible and preservable. The brown sugar, butter and cinnamon filling stays true to tradition and its irresistible flavor is further enhanced by a delicious glaze, made using the same ingredients and cream. Fantastic for breakfast or brunch, cinnamon rolls with liquid sordough starter are perfect for all the family!
