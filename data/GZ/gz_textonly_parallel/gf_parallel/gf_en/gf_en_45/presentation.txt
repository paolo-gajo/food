Love is when to halves perfectly complete one another. The giving of flowers and chocolates is a timelessly romantic gesture, but what we need is something that pays tribute to a perfect union. On Valentine's day what could be better than some homemade sweetness? Two color heart cookies are your unmistakable love message...a plain and cocoa dough set in the sweetest of puzzles of poetry and taste. Two different colored hearts hold each other tight in a delicious embrace, bringing to life unique, fragrant and original homemade cookies. Two color heart cookies are the perfect gift for all the special people in your life: simply place them in a bag and tie with a nice red ribbon!
