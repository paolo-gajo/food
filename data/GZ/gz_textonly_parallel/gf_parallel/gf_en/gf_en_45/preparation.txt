To prepare two color heart cookies, start by placing the cold butter in the bowl of a planetary mixer fitted with a leaf hook [1]. Add the brown sugar [2] and the salt [3]. Stir at a moderate speed into a homogeneous and creamy mixture. 
Add the yolks [4] and mix to thoroughly stir them in. Add the flour [5] and continue to mix until stirred in [6]. 
Place on a work top [7] and knead for a few seconds by hand to make it more compact. Divide the dough in half [8] and place one half in the planetary mixer. Add the cocoa [9] 
and knead with the leaf hook until absorbed [10]. Now you have two doughs: a plain one and a dark one [11]. Separately wrap them in plastic wrap [12] and leave to rest in the refrigerator for an hour
Once this time is up, roll the plain dough out with a rolling pin until 0.4"-0.8" thick [13]. Now roll the cocoa dough out to the same thickness [14]. Use a 2.9" wide and 2.8" long heart-shaped mold to make the first cookie.  
Press a smaller heart-shaped mold, 1.8" wide and 1.6" long, down on the heart-shaped cookie [16], to create a larger hollow heart and a smaller full one. Separate and keep both parts [17], because you'll need them soon.  Now do the same with the cocoa dough: make a heart-shaped cookie and then another one using a smaller mold [18].
Separate both just like you did for the plain dough [19]. Now take a tray lined with parchment paper and place the larger cocoa heart-shaped cookies on it, and a white smaller cookie in the middle of each one [20] to create the two color effect. Repeat with the larger plain dough hearts, by placing the smaller dark hearts in the middle of each one [21]. 
Continue until you use up both doughs [22]. Bake the biscuits in a static oven preheated to 356°F (180°C) for 15 minutes on the lowest shelf. Poi  then remove from the oven and leave the cookies to cool before moving them from the tray and serving [24].
