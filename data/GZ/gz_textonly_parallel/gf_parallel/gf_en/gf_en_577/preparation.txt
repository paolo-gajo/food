To make avocado and chocolate popsicles, first clean the avocado: cut it in half [1], remove the central core [2], remove the pulp with a teaspoon and place it in a tall-sided glass [3].
Add coconut milk [4], honey [5], lemon juice [6]
and water [7]. Blend everything [8] until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream [9].
Pour the mixture into some popsicle molds [10]. we used a mold of 10 popsicles with a capacity of 70 ml (2 1/3 oz) each. Insert the stick [11] and place in the freezer for at least 4 hours. Meanwhile, chop the dark chocolate [12] and melt it in a bain-marie or in the microwave.
When your popsicles are ready, unmold them by placing the mold under running water [13] to facilitate the extraction (14-15).
Now take care of the decoration: dip the tips of the popsicles in the chocolate [16] to create a diagonal glaze, cover the chocolate part with the chopped hazelnuts [17] and immediately enjoy your avocado and chocolate popsicles [18]!
