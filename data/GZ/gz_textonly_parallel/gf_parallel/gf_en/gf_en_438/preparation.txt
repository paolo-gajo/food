To make eggplant bites, start by washing the vegetables; place them on an oven tray lined with parchment paper [1] and bake in a static oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 1 hour. Once baked [2], leave the eggplants to cool before removing the skin and stalk [3].
Place the pulp in a colander and gently press with a fork [4] to remove any excess liquid [5]. Place the eggplant puree in a clean glass bowl, add the egg and a previously crushed garlic clove [6].
Now add the breadcrumbs and the grated Parmigiano Reggiano [7], as well as salt and pepper to taste [8]. Wash, finely chop the parsley [9]
and stir it into the mixture [10]. Stir all the ingredients [11] thoroughly together by hand [12]. If the mixture is too liquid, add some more breadcrumbs.
When ready, take a small amount and roll it into a walnut-sized ball by hand [13], then coat in the breadcrumbs [14]. Once you have finished all the mixture, heat some oil in a saucepan to 340°F (170°C) (use a cooking thermometer to measure the exact temperature). When the oil is hot, add a few balls at a time [15]
and wait for 2-3 minutes [16], until nice and golden, drain [17] and place them on a tray lined with kitchen paper, which will absorb the excess oil. Serve your eggplant bites piping hot [18]!
