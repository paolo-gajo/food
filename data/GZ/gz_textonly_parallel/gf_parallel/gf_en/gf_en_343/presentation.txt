So many are the nice and delicious cakes eaten at Carnival, but there is one treat you must definitely try: migliaccio!  A traditional dish from Campania with very ancient origins. Traditionally, the main ingredient was millet: Flour obtained from this grain was a customary ingredient in many Neapolitan “cucina povera” recipes. These days, semolina is generally used instead. It’s cooked in a mixture of milk and butter and then combined with other basic ingredients such as eggs, sugar, and ricotta cheese. As simple to prepare as it is unique in taste and texture, migliaccio is bound to become one of your favorite desserts, especially on joyful and colorful Carnival-like occasions. Bring it proudly to the table and your guests won’t be able to resist popping their streamers to celebrate!
