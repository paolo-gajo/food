To prepare the migliaccio, first cook the semolina. Combine milk, water [1], salt [2], and butter [3] in a saucepan, 
then add the orange zest [4] and heat, stirring occasionally to melt the butter. Bring to a boil, then remove the orange zest [5] and pour in the semolina, stirring continuously with a whisk [6]. Lower the heat and simmer for about 4-5 minutes,
the time it takes for the mixture to thicken [7]. Transfer to a baking dish to cool [8]. Meanwhile, prepare the rest of the mixture: Strain the ricotta to make it soft and creamy [9], then remove the seeds from the vanilla bean by slicing it lengthwise and scraping out the insides with the tip of a small knife.
Combine the eggs, vanilla seeds, and sugar [10] in a bowl, then whisk the ingredients together until the mixture is pale and smooth. Now gradually add the ricotta [11] followed by the semolina, continuing to whisk [12]. You should get an even mixture that’s well blended without any lumps.
Oil a 9-inch (24-cm) cake pan, line with parchment paper, then pour in the mixture [13] and level the surface with a spatula [14]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 60 minutes (if the top is well-browned after 40-50 minutes, cover with a sheet of foil and keep cooking). Your migliaccio is ready [15]: Before cutting and serving, allow it to cool in the pan, then turn it out and dust the surface with powdered sugar to taste.
