Baked pasta dishes are our favorites! Sedanini pasticciati, a dish which succeeds in making even broccoli tasty, conchiglioni filled with tomato sauce and pasta alla sorrentina with lashings of melted mozzarella! We have no shortage of ideas and baked pasta dishes can come in endless permutations. Baked trofie pasta is a shining example: Here, the pasta is married to a flavorful sausage sauce enhanced by a creamy béchamel sauce. The topping is finished off with a scattering of provola cheese before the dish goes into the oven to brown. The result is a perfect steaming dish to bear to the table for Sunday lunch or when you have friends over for dinner. You won’t get much leftover after you make this baked trofie pasta, but even if you do, it will still taste wonderful when reheated!
