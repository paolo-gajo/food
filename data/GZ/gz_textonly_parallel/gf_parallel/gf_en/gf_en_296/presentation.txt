Towards the end of the Second World War the legendary carbonara was created in Rome, from the encounter of American soldiers and local cooks. Over the years, many tasty variations of this historic recipe have been created, with potatoes, or vegetables, or seafood, but the common denominator is still the delicious egg and cheese cream that is often a challenge even for the most skilled chefs! And paccheri (pasta sleeves) carbonara with artichokes are no exception: the seasoning is prepared separately and added over a low heat to obtain the right creaminess. If you add to this the savory note of smoked bacon cubes and the unique taste of artichokes, the result can only be amazing! Follow our instructions step by step and bring to the table paccheri (pasta sleeves) carbonara with artichokes from the stove and... enjoy your creation!
