Penne all’arrabbiata (penne in a garlic and chili tomato sauce) is typical of Roman cuisine, but known everywhere in Italy and even further afield. By now, it’s become famous enough to join the ranks of classic pasta dishes such as spaghetti cacio e pepe, pasta alla puttanesca, and pasta alla carbonara. It’s a pasta dish that comes together quickly using just a few simple ingredients, with an unmistakable flavor. You’ll quickly see that you’ve created a real work of culinary art! And it’s even the star of unforgettable Italian films such as La Grande Abbuffata, directed by Marco Ferreri, or 7 chili in 7 giorni (“7 Kilos in 7 Days”), directed by Luca Verdone. Penne all’arrabbiata is a much-loved recipe, often used as a throw-together snack when friends get together since it’s quick and easy to make.  The name “arrabiata” is unique. In Italian, it means “angry,” and it seems to come from the fact that someone eating it runs the risk of having their face turn red thanks to the chili in it, giving them the look of a person whose face has turned red out of anger! Some restaurants recommend adding plenty of Pecorino Romano cheese, so feel free to do so yourself.
