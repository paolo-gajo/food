To make penne all’arrabbiata, start by draining the peeled tomatoes. Transfer them to a bowl [1] and crush them with a fork [2] to break them up [3].  
Next, crumble the dried chili [4]. Place a pot full of water, salted to taste, on the stove to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, pour a drizzle of oil [5] into a pan and add the peeled garlic clove [6].
Now add the chili [7] and fry it lightly over low heat [8], then add the tomatoes [9].
Stir [10] it and add salt to taste [11]. Cover the pan with a lid [12] and let this sauce cook for around 12 minutes, stirring every so often. 
When the sauce is nearly ready, put the pasta on to cook as well. Cook it al dente, following the cooking times stated on the packaging [13]. Once 12 minutes have passed, take the lid off the pan [14] and remove the garlic [15]. 
Drain the pasta and pour it directly into the sauce [16]. Heat through for a minute [17], adding some of the cooking water if necessary [18], then turn off the heat. 
Add the chopped parsley [19], stir once more [20], and serve your penne all'arrabbiata while still hot [21].
