To prepare the pear and chocolate strudel, start by placing the butter in a pan [1]. Melt it, then add the breadcrumbs [2] and leave to brown for a few minutes, stirring all the while. As soon as it is ready, place in a bowl and leave to one side [3].
Finely chop the almonds [4] and the chocolate [5], and leave to one side. Now you can prepare the pears. Peel and tip them on both ends [6],
cut them into 4 pieces and remove the core [7]. Lastly, thinly slice the pears and place them in a bowl [8]. Add the dark chocolate [9],
the almonds [10], the brown sugar [11], the powdered ginger [12] and
the cinnamon [13]. Mix everything well [14]. Unroll the puff pastry and imagine dividing it into 3 pieces lengthwise. The filling will go on the central part; cut both side parts into slanted slices that are 0.4 in wide [15].
Now cover the central part, first with the toasted breadcrumbs [16] and then with the pear and chocolate filling [17]. One at a time, lift both side strips and place over the central part, in alternation [18].
This way you will achieve a cage effect [19]. Discard any leftover pieces of dough. Lastly, brush a little cream onto the strips [20] and sprinkle with the brown sugar [21].
Bake in a static oven preheated to 400?F for around 20 minutes [22]. Once baked [23], leave the pear and chocolate strudel to cool thoroughly before cutting into slices and enjoying it [24].
