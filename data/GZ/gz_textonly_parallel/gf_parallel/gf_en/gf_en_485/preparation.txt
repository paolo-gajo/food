To prepare chocolate coconut bars, place the shredded coconut in a bowl. Add the condensed milk [1] and stir with a spatula [2]. Now add the salt [3] and stir some more.
Place the mixture on a sheet of parchment paper [4] and press it by hand [5] to form a 5.5 x 4 inch rectangle. It will need to be 0.8 inches thick [6]. Leave to cool in the refrigerator for around 1 hour.
Remove the mixture from the refrigerator; use a long bladed knife to cut it in half lengthwise [7] and then into 6 pieces lengthwise, to make 12 bars [8]. Delicately shape each one by hand to smooth the corners [9].
Place them on a tray as you shape them one by one [10], then leave them in the refrigerator. In the meantime, finely chop the chocolate [11] and place 7 oz in a bowl and 1.8 oz in another [12].
Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie or in the microwave. With the latter, heat in short bursts of a few seconds each so as not to burn the chocolate; stir every 30 seconds until fully melted [13]. In the meantime, remove the bars from the refrigerator; they should not be too cold otherwise when coated the chocolate would crystallize immediately. As soon as the chocolate melts, add the part you left to one side [14] and stir with a spatula. Continue stirring until the chocolate reaches 86°F (30°C). This chocolate tempering technique is called seeding, and is the simplest method. In the meantime, line a grille with a sheet of parchment paper.
As soon as the chocolate reaches the right temperature, dip the bars in it, using a fork [16]. Remove the bars from the chocolate and gently tap to remove any excess chocolate [17]. Place them on the grille [18] and continue covering the rest of the bars in the chocolate.
Decorate with a little shredded coconut on the surface [19] and leave to crystallize at room temperature [20]. If it's too hot, then place the bars in the refrigerator. You can serve the chocolate coconut bars as soon as the chocolate fully dries.
