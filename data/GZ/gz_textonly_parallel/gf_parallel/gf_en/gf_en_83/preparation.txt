To prepare the stuffed zucchini, wash the zucchini under running water, dry them with a clean cloth, and cut off the top to form the lid [1]. Score the inner perimeter with a small knife, then make an X in the flesh [2] and remove one segment at a time [3].
Next, scoop out the inside using a melon baller or teaspoon [4], creating a shell around ?” (1 cm) thick [5]. This way, you’ll have both the lids and the shells ready to be stuffed. Season the insides of the zucchini [6] with salt and bake in the oven at 390°F (200°C) for 15 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the filling: Place the ground pork [7] in a bowl and add the sausage, with the skin already removed [8], and the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [9].
 
Then add the chopped zucchini flesh [10], the egg, lightly beaten [11], and the chopped breadcrumb [12].
Now add the chopped parsley, season with salt and pepper [13], and combine the mixture with your hands [14] until it’s even [15].
Grease a deep baking dish with a good glug of oil [16]. Take the (cooked) zucchini and put them in the dish [17], then fill them to the brim with the stuffing you just made [18].
Put the lids in the dish as well and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 340°F (170°C) for around 60 minutes. Once the stuffed zucchini have gone golden and crispy on the surface [19], take them out of the oven and serve them up [20], placing the lids on top of the stuffing [21].
