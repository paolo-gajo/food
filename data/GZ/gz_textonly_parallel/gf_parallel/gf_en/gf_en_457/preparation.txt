To prepare colomba tiramisu, start by slicing the colomba [1]. Then, using a cookie cutter with a diameter of 3 inches (a glass will work fine if you don't have one), cut the colomba into discs [2] and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [3].
At this point, bake them for 10 minutes at 320°F (160°C), in order to toast them, flipping them halfway through cooking [4]. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: separate the yolks from the whites into two containers [5] and, with the help of a whisk, beat the yolks together with the sugar [6].
Once you have obtained a clear and fluffy foam [7], gradually add the mascarpone with the beaters still running [8]; when the mixture is nice and foamy, add the grated orange zest [9] and lightly mix with a spatula.
In the other container, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites [10] until stiff peaks form [11], then gently fold them into the mixture of egg yolks and mascarpone, mixing from the bottom to the top so as not to deflate the cream [12].
Cut the orange in half and squeeze it [13], then pour the juice into a container with a strainer [14], in order to filter it carefully and not have any pulp residues in the mixture. Collect the juice in a bowl, pour in the Grand Marnier [15], and mix well with a spoon.
Grate the chocolate onto a cutting board [16] and set it aside. Now move on to preparing the colomba tiramisu; take some small cups with a diameter of about 3 inches and pour a thin layer of cream into each one [17]. To make this easier, you can transfer the mascarpone cream to a pastry bag. Next, place a crispy colomba disc in each cup on top of the cream [18].
With the help of a teaspoon, soak the layer of colomba cake [19] with orange juice syrup, add another layer of cream [20], and sprinkle generously with dark chocolate flakes [21].
Repeat the same process again, alternating the toasted colomba disc [22] soaked with orange syrup [23] and the cream; finish with grated chocolate flakes [24]. Keep the cups in the refrigerator for at least an hour so that the colomba tiramisu can set before serving!
