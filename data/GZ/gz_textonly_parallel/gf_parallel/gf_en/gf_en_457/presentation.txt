Colomba is a type of Italian Easter cake similar to panettone. It has a dove-like shape, hence its name, as "colomba" means dove in Italian. It's typically made with flour, eggs, sugar, butter, and candied fruits, and often topped with almonds and sugar glaze. It's a popular dessert during the Easter season in Italy and can be found in many bakeries and supermarkets.
