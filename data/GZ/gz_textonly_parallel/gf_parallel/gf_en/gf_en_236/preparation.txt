To prepare pistachio tiramisu, put the pistachios in a blender [1] and blend them until they are reduced to a powder, then gradually pour in the sesame oil [2] and continue blending until you obtain a cream [3]. Prepare the coffee with a moka pot and let it cool down.
To pasteurize the eggs: put a pot with a thick bottom on the stove, pour in the water [4] and sugar [5], bring the syrup to a boil while monitoring the temperature with a food thermometer. When the temperature reaches 239째F (115째C), start beating the egg yolks separately with an electric mixer [6].
When the syrup reaches 250째F (121째C) [7], remove it from the heat and pour it slowly into the bowl where you started whisking the egg yolks [8]. Keep whisking at low speed until the mixture cools down and becomes clear and foamy, this will take around 10-12 minutes. Then add the mascarpone cheese [9] while still whisking with the beaters.
Finally, add the pistachio cream [10], keeping the beaters running until it is fully combined [11]. Now, cut the ladyfingers in half [12].
Pour the coffee prepared with the moka into a low and wide bowl [13]. Then, dilute it with 30 g of room temperature water. Everything is ready to make the tiramisu: take 4 glasses with a capacity of 140 ml each, and using a piping bag, squeeze the cream onto the bottom to create a first layer [14]. Continue by dipping two halves of ladyfingers into the bowl with coffee and water [15]
and then placing them inside the glass, creating the second layer. Continue by squeezing more cream [16], dust the surface with bitter cocoa [17], and then continue with another layer of ladyfingers [18]
then another layer of cream [19], and finally finish with bitter cocoa and chopped pistachios [20]. Let it cool in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. The pistachio tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed [21]!
