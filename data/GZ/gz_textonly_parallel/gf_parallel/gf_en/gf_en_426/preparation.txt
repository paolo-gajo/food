To make the flourless chocolate cake, first melt the dark chocolate in the microwave or a bain-marie, and then allow to cool slightly [1]. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk together the butter, softened beforehand and at room temperature, and sugar [2] to get a creamy mixture. You can also whip the butter using a hand mixer with a whisk attachment. Add the eggs one at a time, waiting until the one before one has been mixed in well [3].
Now add the vanilla extract [4]; separately, sift the cocoa powder [5] and then add it to the butter, egg, and sugar mixture, one spoonful at a time [6].
Then add the salt [7] and finally the lukewarm chocolate [8]. Mix all the other ingredients together using a spatula [9].
Butter a 9–9.5-inch (22–24-cm) [10] cake pan and line with parchment paper, then pour the cake batter in [11] and level it using the back of a spoon, distributing it evenly in the pan [12].
Bake the cake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 30-35 minutes (320°F (160°C) for 20-25 minutes in a convection oven). Once a delicate crust has formed, remove the cake from the oven and leave to cool [13]. You can keep the cake with the crust on the top, or else turn it over using a dinner plate. Sprinkle with plenty of powdered sugar [14]  and your flourless chocolate cake is ready to go [15]!
