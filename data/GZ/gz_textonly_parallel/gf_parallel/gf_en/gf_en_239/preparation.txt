To make piadina romagnola, prepare the dough by mixing flour, salt [1], lard [2] and baking soda [3] in a bowl.
Start kneading and add the water in 3 parts [4], then transfer the mixture to the work surface [5] and continue to work until a uniform mixture is obtained. Form a ball, wrap it in a food bag and let it rest for 30 minutes [6].
After the resting time, remove the dough from the bag and shape it into a sausage [7], then divide it into 6 equal parts [8]. Shape each part of the dough into a ball by kneading it for about 30 seconds so that it becomes smooth and even, then wrap them with a food bag again and let them rest for another 30 minutes [9].
After the rest time has elapsed, lightly flour the worktop [10] and roll out the balls with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/10" (2-3 mm) [11]. Heat a plate very hot and in the meantime roll the flatbreads out further, then cup them with a 8 1/2" (22 cm) [12] diameter pasta cutter.
Now cook the flatbreads on one side for 2 minutes, turning them continuously with one hand to ensure even cooking [13], then flip them and cook them for 2 minutes on the other side [14], until they are slightly golden. Once cooked, stack your flatbreads on top of each other and stuff them while still warm [15]!
