To prepare the cantucci, start by placing the sugar [1] in a bowl, then add the egg with a pinch of salt. Stir with a spatula [2]: there is no need to beat the mixture, just dissolve the sugar crystals well. Separately, in another bowl, place the flour and the baker's ammonia [3].
Mix and add the dry ingredients to the egg and sugar mixture [4]. Mix and add the soft butter [5] as well. Knead with your hands [6]
and add the almonds [7], the Marsala wine [8] and the grated rind of half an organic orange [9]. Knead until all the ingredients are well blended, then form a small loaf and place it on the worktop.
Divide the loaf into two equal parts [10] and cut a long and rather narrow roll from each [9]. Place the rolls well spaced out on a drip pan covered with baking paper (there is no need to flatten them, it will happen naturally while baking). Brush your rolls with beaten egg yolk [12] (if the yolk is too thick, you can dilute it with a little water).
Cook the rolls in a static oven preheated to 400°F (200°C) for 20 minutes [13], then take them out of the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Then, with a knife with a serrated knife, cut the rolls slightly diagonally, creating about 1/2-inch (1.2 cm) thick cantucci (almond cookies) [14]. Place them back on the baking tray covered with baking paper and toast them in a static oven preheated to 320°F (160°C) for 18 minutes [15]. Take out your cantucci and let them cool  before tasting them...accompanied by a nice little glass of vin santo!
