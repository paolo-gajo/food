Veal Milanese (Breaded veal cutlet) is a perennial favorite everyone loves, from children to adults. There are those who prefer it thin and crunchy, or those who like it thick, with the bone and slightly pink inside. This is the case with one of the best chefs in Lombardy, whom we are hosting with great honor today in the kitchen of GialloZafferano: Claudio Sadler. The chef has explained all the secrets to getting the perfect Veal Milanese. Unlike the Viennese, made with pork, the Milanese is prepared with tender veal which has a more delicate taste. The secret is all in the double breading: with a few added touches, and because it's cooked in abundant clarified butter the breading will become crispy and will stay on the meat, without coming off during cooking. A second course easy to prepare, accompanied by tasty ratte potatoes. A symbol of the cuisine in the Lombard capital, which will win over all your guests!
