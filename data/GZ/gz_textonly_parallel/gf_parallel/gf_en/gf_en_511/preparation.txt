To prepare the cheese fondue bread bowl, start by cutting a spherical cap in a loaf of durum wheat bread, around 6 inches in diameter [1]. Use a 3.5 inch (9 cm) shaping ring mold to eliminate the inner soft part and create a regular shaped inside [2]; remove the soft inner part with a spoon [3] and leave to one side.
Now you have all three parts of the bread you'll need [4]. Remove the protective wax coating from the cheese [5], place the cheese inside the loaf, replace the 'lid' [6] and bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C), for around 30 minutes. In the meantime, bring some water to the boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste and cook the new potatoes for around 10 minutes.
Cut the soft inner part of the bread left to one side into sticks, each around 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) thick. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add a mix of aromatic herbs and the chopped soft bread [8], brown for around 5 minutes on a high flame, until golden on all sides [9]. When ready, remove the crisp sticks and leave them to one side.
In the same pan, saute the previously blanched new potatoes on a high flame (10-11). Remove the loaf from the oven, place it in the middle of the table on a cutting board and serve with cheese fondue bread bowl, accompanied with some croutons, new potatoes, carrots, or whatever ingredients you prefer [12]!
