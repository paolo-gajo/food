To prepare the no-bake ricotta cake, start from the base. Finely chop the dark chocolate with a knife and place it in a bowl suitable for microwave cooking [1]. Melt the chocolate in the microwave at maximum power for a few seconds, then remove the bowl and mix the chocolate with a spoon. Put it back in the microwave, heat for a few more seconds at maximum power and then mix it again. Repeat this operation until the chocolate has melted completely [2]. Heat the puffed rice in the microwave at maximum power for about 30 seconds, this way there will be no thermal shock once the two ingredients are combined. If you do not have a microwave, you can melt the chocolate in a bain-marie and heat the puffed rice in the oven (or in a pan over very low heat), by distributing it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. In a bowl pour the hot puffed rice, then add the melted chocolate [3]
stir to mix the ingredients well [4]. Transfer the mixture obtained in a rectangular tart mold (possibly with removable bottom), distribute the puffed rice mixture evenly throughout the mold [5], and finally press it with the back of the spoon in order to compact it at best [6]. Once the base is made, place it in the refrigerator to harden for about 1 hour.
In the meantime, prepare the cream: sift the ricotta through a sieve to make it finer [7], then add the icing sugar [8] and finally cut the vanilla pod lengthwise and with a small knife extract the seeds to flavor the cream [9]
Mix the cream with a spatula to make it homogeneous [10], resume the mold with the now firm base [11], fill it with half of the ricotta cream, distribute it over the entire surface and compact it with the back of the spoon [12]
Pour the remaining half of the cream into a pasty bag with a drop nozzle and distribute the filling on the central part of the cake creating a wavy pattern [13] [14]. Now wash the peaches and slice them finely, keeping the peel [15].
Garnish the cake by distributing the peach slices on both sides [16] [17]. Finally, add a touch of color by adding the bunches of currant and fresh mint leaves [18]. Your no-bake ricotta cake is ready to be enjoyed!
