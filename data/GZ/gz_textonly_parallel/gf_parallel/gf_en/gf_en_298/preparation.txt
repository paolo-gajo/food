To make the Milanese-style ossobuco, first prepare the meat broth that you will use to cook the veal shanks, then peel the onions and cut them into flakes [1]. Heat half of the oil in a pan, add the onions [2] and cook for about 5 minutes over medium-high heat, then blend with half of the white wine [3] and cook for another 10 minutes.
Once they are browned [4], remove the onions from the pan that you will also use to cook the veal shanks [5] and set them aside. Now take the veal shanks and, using a pair of scissors, make 3 incisions in the connective tissue of each one to prevent them from curling during cooking [6].
Pour the flour into an ovenproof dish and season with salt [7] and pepper, then stir with a spoon. Flour the veal shanks on both sides [8] and tap them gently to remove any excess flour [9].
Pour the remaining oil into the pan you cooked the onions in, add the butter [10] and let it melt, then place the veal shanks inside and brown them over medium-high heat without touching them [11]. After about 4 minutes turn them over gently and you will see that a delicious crust has formed on the outside [12].
Brown the veal shanks on the other side for about 2 minutes, then blend with the remaining wine [13] and let it evaporate. At this point add the broth so that it almost covers the meat [14], then add the onions [15] and lower the flame.
Cover with a lid [16] and cook over medium-low heat for 35 minutes. In the meantime, peel the garlic cloves and remove the core [17], then boil them in boiling water for 2 minutes [18]: this way the taste of the garlic will be less strong, but if you prefer you can omit this step.
After 35 minutes of cooking, turn the veal shanks [19] over very gently, cover again with the lid [20] and continue cooking for another 25 minutes. In the meantime, wash the parsley and chop it finely together with the blanched garlic cloves [21].
When cooked, turn off the heat and add the chopped parsley and garlic in the pan, then flavor with the grated rind of a whole lemon [23]: your Milanese-style ossobuco is ready to be served and enjoyed [24]!
