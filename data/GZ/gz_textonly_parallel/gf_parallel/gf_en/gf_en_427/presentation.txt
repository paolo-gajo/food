Fish soup is a tasty dish made with fresh fish, a must in the culinary tradition of the Italian maritime regions. Each town overlooking the sea has its own recipe; just think of the famous light broth of Fano, typical clam soup, or simple fish stew. What makes this soup so special is the fish stock with its intense flavor made with the fish leftovers which release all their aromas during the cooking. If you accompany your soup with slices of homemade bread, you will give a rustic and genuine touch to this delicious first course. Although a bit laborious, fish soup deserves to be prepared: its flavors and aromas will transport you next to the sea for a day!
