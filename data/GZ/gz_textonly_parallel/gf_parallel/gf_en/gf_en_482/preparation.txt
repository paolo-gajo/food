To prepare the chocolate custard cream, start by chopping the dark chocolate [1]. Pour the milk into a saucepan, add the seeds of a vanilla bean and steep the bean [2]. Turn the heat on and bring it to a boil. In the meantime, you can pour the sugar into another pot [3].
Now add the yolks [4] and mix together [5]. Add the corn starch [6] and a pinch of salt.
Then, pour a little hot milk over the mixture to dilute it, taking care to remove the beans left in the infusion [7] first, and mix. Then pour all the rest while continuing to stir with a hand whisk [8]. Place back on the stove and let the cream thicken over medium heat. Once thickened [9], turn off the heat and transfer it to a bowl.
Now all that remains is to add the chopped dark chocolate [10] and stir with a whisk [11] until it is completely melted and mixed in. Your chocolate custard cream is now ready [12]. You can let it cool by covering it with plastic wrap so that a crust does not form on the surface. Then you can use it to fill cakes and pastries, to decorate, or as a soft dessert.
