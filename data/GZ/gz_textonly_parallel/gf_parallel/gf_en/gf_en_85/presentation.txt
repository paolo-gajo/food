How many ways can a pumpkin be cooked? Its orange color and sweet pulp make it unique, which is why it stars in so many delicious autumn recipes: starters, first and second courses and desserts too: there is a special recipe for every part of your meal. Pumpkin gnocchi, for lovers of home tradition, delicious balls for enriching a buffet with evening drinks, refined braised pumpkin, perfect for Sunday lunch, and lastly, soft and subtly rustic pumpkin cake, reminiscent of grandma's desserts. The list is long, tantalizing and now also includes delicious and scenographic stuffed pumpkin, because looks aren't everything, but they certainly help. Not only is this side dish rich and filling, it is genuine too, which proves how flavor can be added in a healthy and nourishing way.
