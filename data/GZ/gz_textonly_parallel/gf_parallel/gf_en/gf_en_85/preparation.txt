To prepare stuffed pumpkin, start by tipping [1] the pumpkin, cutting it in half lengthwise [2] and scooping the seeds and filaments out with a spoon [3].
Use a fruit scooper (or a teaspoon) to remove the pumpkin pulp (4-5) and place 7 oz of it in a bowl. Place the pumpkin on a tray lined with parchment paper, add the peeled and halved garlic cloves, the sprigs of rosemary and thyme [6]
and season with 0.1 cups of oil [7]. Bake both halves of the emptied and seasoned pumpkin in a static oven preheated to 355째F (180째C) for 20 minutes. In the meantime, mince the pumpkin pulp left to one side [8] and place it in a bowl; drain the precooked chickpeas and beans [9]
and add them to the pumpkin in the bowl [10]. Wash the tomatoes and cut them into four pieces [11]; thinly slice the olives [12]
and the leek [13]. Lastly, coarsely chop the hazelnuts [14]. Add the tomatoes to the filling [15],
along with the olives [16], the leeks and the hazelnuts [17]; add salt, pepper and season with fresh oregano [18].
By now the pumpkin will be done: remove it from the oven [19] and fill with the previously prepared stuffing [20]. Bake once more in the oven at 190째F (87째C) for around 20 minutes. Once baked, remove the stuffed pumpkin from the oven [21], leave it to cool and serve warm.
