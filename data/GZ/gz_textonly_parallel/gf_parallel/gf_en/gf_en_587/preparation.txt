To make the apple cake, first melt the butter in the microwave or over a bain-marie, and set aside. Grate the lemon zest [1] and squeeze the juice out of it to obtain around 2 tbsp (30 g) [2], then set both the zest and the juice aside. Slice the apples in half and remove the cores [3].
Peel the apples [4], then cut them into quarters [5], and slice them down the short side [6].
Place the sliced apples in a bowl, sprinkle them with the lemon juice [7], and mix well. This will help prevent them from going brown. Next, sift the cake flour with the baking powder [8]. Then, pour the eggs [9] 
and some of the sugar [10] into a large bowl. Start beating with a hand mixer [11] and continue pouring in the sugar a little at a time [12].
When the mixture begins to lighten, add a pinch of salt [13] and continue whisking until the mixture is light and fluffy. At this point, add the melted butter, now at room temperature [14]. Flavor with the cinnamon powder [15]
and add the grated lemon peel [16]. Add the sifted flour and baking powder a spoonful at a time [17], continuing to whisk as you do so. Once the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed in, lower the speed of the hand mixer and drizzle in the milk, which should also be at room temperature [18].
Once the milk is thoroughly mixed in, turn off the mixer; the cake batter is ready [19]. Drain the apples in a colander to remove the lemon juice [20] and add them to the mixture [21].
Gently mix from the bottom up to ensure the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated [22]. Butter and sprinkle with sugar a 9-inch (22-cm) cake pan and pour in the batter [23] with the help of a spatula. The cake is ready to be baked [24] in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for around 55 minutes.
Once baked, take it out of the oven [25] and leave to cool completely before removing it from the pan. Dust the cake with powdered sugar [26] and serve [27]: Your apple cake is ready to be enjoyed!
