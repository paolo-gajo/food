To make this eggplant pasta bake, start with the béchamel sauce: Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it’s lukewarm. At the same time, melt the butter over low heat [1] in another saucepan. Once melted, add all of the flour at once [2]. Whisk together quickly and, once you have a roux, pour in the lukewarm milk in three portions [3].
Cook for about 5-6 minutes, stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps [4] without letting the sauce thicken too much [5]; set aside and leave to cool. Wash, trim, and then slice the eggplant, using a mandoline if possible, to get slices about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick [6].
Fry a few slices of eggplant at a time in vegetable oil at approximately 340°F (170° C) (measure using a kitchen thermometer) (7-8) and drain on oil-absorbing paper for fried food [9].
Next, heat the water for the pasta and add salt when it reaches a boil. Dice the provolone cheese (10-11), then cook the fusilli until they are al dente [12].
In the meantime, drain and cut the sun-dried tomatoes into small pieces and pour three-quarters into the cooled béchamel sauce [13], season with salt and pepper to taste, then blend it all together using an immersion blender [14]. Pour the béchamel sauce with sun-dried tomatoes into a bowl, add the fusilli, which have been cooked al dente and then drained, and stir to combine [15].
Add almost all of the diced provolone [16] and nearly all of Grana Padano cheese [17], reserving 1½ tbsp (10 g). Mix well with a spatula [18].
Arrange the fried eggplant in a baking dish, making sure to line the bottom [19] and lay all the eggplant along the dish so that they overflow slightly [20]. Pour the pasta in the sauce over the eggplant, spreading it evenly [21].
Lastly, sprinkle with the remaining Grana Padano cheese [22]. Fold the eggplant over the pasta [23] and top with the reserved provolone cheese [24].
Add the remaining sun-dried tomatoes (25-26). Bake in a convection oven preheated to 360°F (180°C) for 12 minutes. Once you’ve taken the eggplant pasta bake out of the oven, you can decorate it with fresh basil leaves [27] before serving it piping hot.
