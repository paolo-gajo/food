Polenta has always been associated with appetizing and delicious pairings such as sausage and cheese – bold flavors in other words! You can expect no less from our recipe for polenta medallions: soft discs of polenta wrapped in delicious strips of bacon and topped with a layer of string cheese. Baking them in an oven will make them a tad less calorific than the fried version of polenta chips! These appetizing, hearty, flavor-packed morsels make an ideal appetizer or second course. They are a delicious and sophisticated alternative to the more traditional dish of polenta with cheese and undoubtedly more appealing!
