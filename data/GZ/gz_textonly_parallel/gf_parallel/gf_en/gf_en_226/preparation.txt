To prepare the polenta medallions, first fill a deep saucepan with 3 cups (750 g) of water and set over low heat. When the water boils, add salt [1] and pour in approximately Â¾ tbsp (10 g) of olive oil [2], then add the polenta flour slowly, beating all the time [3]. 
Cook over low heat for 8 minutes, continuing to stir with a spoon to prevent lumps [4] from forming. After the end of the cooking time, turn off the heat [5] and pour the polenta into an oiled baking dish. Spread the polenta with a spatula [6], but do not cover the entire base of the dish. 
You should create a layer approximately 1 inch (2 cm) thick and the resulting square should be 8x8 inches (20x20 cm) [7]. Cover with plastic wrap [8] and place in the refrigerator to set for 30 minutes. After this resting time, cut the scamorza cheese into rounds, aiming to obtain 8 slices, each measuring approximately 3 inches (7 cm) in diameter [9].
Take the polenta out of the refrigerator (it will have set in the meantime) and cut out 4 discs [10] using a 3-inch (7 cm) food ring mold. Place the discs on a cutting board [11] and wrap each one in two slices of smoked pancetta so that the edges are well covered [12]. Transfer the discs one by one to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Lay two slices of scamorza cheese on top of each of the resulting medallions [13] and broil for 5 minutes or long enough for the scamorza to melt [14]. When cooked, take the polenta medallions out of the oven, and serve hot [15]!
