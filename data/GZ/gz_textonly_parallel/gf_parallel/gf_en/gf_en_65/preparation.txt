To prepare the Tiramisu Cake, start with the ladyfinger base; you'll need to bake one base at a time. Take the 4 eggs required for the bases and separate the yolks from the whites: the eggs should be at room temperature. Pour the 80g of yolks into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and add half of the sugar gradually [1], while the stand mixer is running [2], and beat until you obtain a light and fluffy mixture [3] which you will set aside.
Now whip the egg whites: thoroughly clean the bowl of the stand mixer and the whisk if using the same one, otherwise, you can use a bowl and an electric beater. Pour in the 120 grams of egg whites [4], start the whisk, then gradually add the remaining portion of granulated sugar, not all at once but in 3-4 batches [5], whip the mixture until it reaches stiff peaks [6].
Incorporate the beaten egg whites into the previously prepared egg yolks, little by little, gently folding from bottom to top to avoid deflating the mixture [7]. At this point, also add the sifted flour [8], continuing to carefully mix from bottom to top to keep the batter light and airy [9].
Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip, and you can now create the first base: line a baking tray with parchment paper, place a steel ring with a diameter of 9'' on top (it's a type of pastry ring mold). Alternatively, you can use the removable ring of a cake pan without the bottom, of the same size. Squeeze the batter inside: start from the center [10] and create a spiral [11] that reaches the edge of the ring. You will have half of the batter left to make a second disc. Dust the surface of the batter spiral with 20g of granulated sugar indicated for dusting the base [12] and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 15 minutes.
Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes. Then, run a long knife blade along the inner edge of the ring to easily detach the base [13]. Remove the ring [14] and set aside the ladyfinger disc. Now you can create the other base by squeezing the remaining mixture inside the ring, following the previous steps, and sprinkle with the remaining granulated sugar before baking at the same temperature for another 15 minutes. Once ready, repeat the same process to remove the second ladyfinger base. Prepare the coffee using a moka pot and, once ready, let it cool completely in a small bowl [15].
Next, you can prepare the mascarpone cream using the pâte à bombe method: in a saucepan, combine granulated sugar [16] and water [17], lightly stir to moisten the sugar, then heat the syrup over medium heat while monitoring the temperature with a food thermometer until it reaches 70°F. While the syrup reaches the temperature, place the 80 grams of egg yolks required for the cream in a stand mixer and whisk them [18]
as soon as the syrup of water and sugar reaches 70°F [19], gradually pour it into the egg yolks while the stand mixer is running [20]. Continue to beat the mixture until it cools completely, becoming clear and foamy at the same time [21]. Then, stop the stand mixer.
In a separate bowl, work the mascarpone with a spoon to soften it, then add it to the just whipped mixture, making sure to first temper a small portion of mascarpone by quickly stirring [22], then gently adding and mixing the remaining portion with careful upward motions [23]. Transfer the cream to a piping bag fitted with a smooth nozzle [24] and refrigerate for storage.
Now take a serving plate with a diameter of approximately 11 inches, place a 10-inch diameter springform pan ring on top with a height of 4 inches, which will help maintain the shape of the cake. Line the edge of the ring with a sheet of cut-to-size food-grade acetate paper [25]. The acetate sheet will make it easier to remove the cake; alternatively, you can butter the ring and adhere parchment paper. Place the first ladyfinger disc inside [26], adjust the closure of the ring to fit, then moisten the base with brewed coffee using a kitchen brush, ensuring the ladyfinger base is well soaked [27].
Fill the ladyfinger base by piping dollops of cream: start from the edge in a circular motion [28], moving towards the center. Once finished [29], dust the surface with half of the amount of unsweetened cocoa powder [30].
Place the second ladyfinger disc on top [31], moisten it well again with the coffee [32], then pipe the cream in the same way, creating small dollops on the surface [33]. Now, refrigerate the cake to firm up for at least 2 hours.
After the two hours have passed, take the cake out of the refrigerator, remove the ring, carefully peel off the acetate sheet [34], dust the surface with the remaining cocoa powder [35], and serve your Tiramisu Cake [36] immediately!
