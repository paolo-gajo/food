To prepare salmon tartare with avocado and toasted almonds, start with the salmon. If you use Norwegian salmon you won't need to treat it before serving, otherwise check you buy a fillet that has been blast chilled; for safety's sake, you can freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0.4Â°F degrees before enjoying it raw (according to Italian Ministry of Health guidelines). Take the salmon fillet and remove any bones [1] and if present, any skin too. Now slice [2] and then finely dice it [3].
Place it in a bowl, add the salt [4], pepper, lime zest [5] and a few drops of tabasco sauce [6].
Peel and grate the ginger [7], place the pulp between two spoons and squeeze to juice it, directly over the tartare [8]. Add the rice vinegar [9]
and finely chopped chives [10]. Cover with some plastic wrap and leave to rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. In the meantime, prepare the avocado cream. Take the fruit, cut it in half [11] and remove the pit [12].
Cut into the avocado pulp with a small knife and scoop it out with a spoon, placing it in a small bowl [13]. Squeeze the lime [14] and add to the avocado pieces [15].
Add a pinch of salt [16] and pepper, mash with a fork [17] to obtain a puree. Wash the tomatoes, cut them into small pieces [18],
add them to the avocado pulp and stir to mix the ingredients together [19]. Toast the blanched almonds [20], taking care not to burn them, then start composing your tartare. Use a 30 in diameter ring mold and a spoon to create the first layer of avocado cream [21]. 
Add the diced and marinated salmon [22], smooth off the surface and delicately remove the ring mold [23]. Garnish the plate with the almond shards and finely chopped chives [24], then serve your salmon tartare with avocado and toasted almonds.
