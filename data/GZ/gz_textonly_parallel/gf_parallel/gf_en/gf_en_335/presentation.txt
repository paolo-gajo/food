One of the most traditional Italian Easter dishes is the pasqualina tart, a savory chard tart with soft layers of puff pastry and symbolism linked to the egg hiding inside. But, if the original recipe seems like a lot of work to you, here’s a simple, quick alternative that even budding chefs can make: mini pasqualina tart parcels! The chard and ricotta filling remains faithful to the original, unlike the version with peas we showed you in the past, while the changes come in the form of the puff pastry casing and single-portion format, perfect for an Easter picnic. And what about the egg, you’re probably thinking? Of course, we couldn’t leave out the quintessential Easter symbol, so don’t worry... you’ll just have to wait for the first bite to savor it in all of its soft goodness! If you’re looking for an alternative appetizer for your Easter lunch or a snack to take along for your Easter picnic, these mini pasqualina tart parcels will be the perfect option.
