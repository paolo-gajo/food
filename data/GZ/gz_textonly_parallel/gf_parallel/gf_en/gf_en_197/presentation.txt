Pumpkin risotto is a real institution in Italian cuisine: a first course prepared with pumpkin encompassing all the warmth of slow cooking, genuine flavors and good homey smell. A dish of peasant origins, like many of the best dishes of the Italian tradition: only intuition, practice and imagination have been able to transform pumpkin and rice into a dish celebrated today by gourmets and loved by connoisseurs. What is so special about pumpkin risotto and what makes it irresistible? We would have to answer its simplicity; a simplicity that embodies wisdom, care, gestures that are immutable, necessary, and practical. For example, the toasting of the rice, which waterproofs the grains giving them an extraordinary resistance to overcooking; the step-by-step cooking method, adding one ladle of broth at a time, since risotto is not boiled rice; the so-called mantecatura, that moment in which the starch transforms the leftover broth into a cream that, thanks to the final touch of butter, will become even more velvety. Many small gestures of the past, make this dish a delight capable of conquering the most refined palates as well as lovers of simple and genuine flavors. A perfect dish for all occasions, from dinner for two to a Halloween party, excellent with added speck, gorgonzola cheese or sausage.
