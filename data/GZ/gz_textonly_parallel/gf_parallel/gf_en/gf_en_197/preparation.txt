To cook pumpkin risotto, start by preparing a light vegetable broth, which you will use to cookthe rice. Cut the vegetables, put them in a large saucepan, cover them with water and add salt [1]. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil and cook for about 1 hour. Filter the broth (2-3) and keep it warm.
Then start preparing the pumpkin: clean it, cut it into slices [4] and then into small cubes [5]. Finely chop the onion [6]
and put it in a large pan with the heated oil [7]. Let the onion sauté over very low heat for about 10 minutes, until it is very soft [8]. Then add the pumpkin [9] and brown it for a few minutes, stirring to keep it from sticking.
Start adding one ladle of broth [10], and then add more, little by little until the pumpkin is cooked (about 20 minutes): it must be very tender and creamy [11]. Heat another large frying pan, add in the rice and toast it [12]. We use the dry method because toasting the rice, an essential step to ensure the grains will develop their resistance to overcooking, cannot be done in a humid environment such as the one created in the other pan.
keep toasting the rice over high heat until it becomes opalescent, turning it often to avoid burning it. This will take 2-3 minutes. Then add the white wine [13] and stir immediately to avoid sticking. As soon as the wine has completely evaporated, pour the rice into the pan with the pumpkin [14]. Mix well to combine the flavors and prevent the rice from sticking [15].
After the wine has evaporated, add a ladle of hot broth [16], and gradually add the next one only after the previous one has been absorbed, until it is properly cooked. This will take 15-20 minutes, depending on the type of rice used. Towards the end of cooking, season with pepper and salt [17]. Finally, remove from the burner, add the butter [18]
and grated Parmesan cheese [19]. Mix with care [20], then add a final ladle of broth if you prefer a creamier risotto. Let it rest for a minute before serving [21].
