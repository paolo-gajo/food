One of the best things about fall is being able to tuck into some roast chestnuts in the park surrounded by the beautiful foliage. Tasty, flavorful, and able to whisk us away to this setting, today’s recipe pairs chestnuts with dark chocolate to create this delicious chestnut and chocolate tart. The captivating and bitter note of the chocolate is a great match for the sweet, woody hints from the chestnuts. Let’s face it, although they’re great on their own, they’re also excellent in other tempting recipes, both sweet and savory: Chestnuts are incredibly versatile and in no case do they go unnoticed, thanks to their unmistakable flavor. We’ve made delectable chestnut and bacon bites, authentic soups, soft doughnuts, and fluffy cakes all with chestnuts, having fun as we combine new and inviting ingredients. With today’s chestnut and chocolate tart, we bring you another luscious pairing in sweet treat with two different textures: crumbly on the outside and soft on the inside. This fall, we’re taking sweet snacks to another level!
