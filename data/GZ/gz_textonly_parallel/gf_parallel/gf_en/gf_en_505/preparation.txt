To make the chestnut and chocolate tart, first prepare the pastry. We’ve decided to use a mixer, but you can also make it by hand like in the video recipe. First, pour the brown sugar [1], cold butter cut into pieces, and the salt [2] into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment. Turn the mixer on briefly to combine the ingredients and then add the whole eggs [3].
Turn the mixer on again to combine everything well and then pour in the flour [4] and work the dough for around 3 minutes. Once the dough is smooth [5], transfer it to a pastry board [6].
Work it to shape it into a small mound, wrap it in plastic wrap [7], and leave in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up. In the meantime, turn to the chestnuts: Make an incision in them with a sharp knife [8] (this will allow you to peel them more easily after cooking), place them in a pot with water on the stove [9], and cook for 20 minutes from when the water is boiling.
Once finished cooking [10], let them cool a little and peel them [11]; you’ll get around 14 oz (400 g) of chestnuts. Put the peeled chestnuts in the bowl of a food processor [12],
chop them roughly [13], and set aside. Chop the dark chocolate as well, using a knife [14]. Now you can start to make the cream: Pour the rice milk and sugar into a saucepan [15], 
then add the chestnuts [16], stir [17], and bring to a boil. At this point, remove the pan from the heat and add the dark chocolate [18] immediately.
Stir so that it melts completely [19], then add the ricotta [20]. Stir again with a whisk and then place it in the fridge for 10 minutes [21].
Go back to the pastry and divide it into two parts, one larger than the other [22]: Roll out the larger part on a lightly floured pastry board, to a thickness of about ¼ inch (4-5 mm) [23]. Use this disc to line a cake pan with an 8-inch (20-cm) diameter [24]
and trim around the edge with a knife [25]. At this point, fill the crostata with the chestnut cream [26], leveling the surface well with a spatula [27].
Now roll out the other part of the pastry, again to a thickness of around ¼ inch (4-5 mm), lay it across the top of the cake pan [28], and trim around the edge. Next, using a dough scraper, stretch the pastry across so it’s spread out well [29], and pinch it to make the two layers of dough stick together and seal it [30].
Bake on the middle rack of a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C), for around 40 minutes. When it’s finished baking, take the chestnut and chocolate tart out of the oven [31], let it cool, and then dust with powdered sugar [32] and serve [33].
