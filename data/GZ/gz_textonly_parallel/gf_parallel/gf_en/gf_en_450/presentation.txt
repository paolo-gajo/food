Rolls of stuffed pasta with a golden crunchy crust, wrapped in velvety b√©chamel sauce. At first glance, they might look like the traditional fresh egg pasta cannelloni. For crespelle (crepes) cannelloni pasta, we have instead combined the classic crepe mix with traditional Bolognese sauce, but nothing prevents you from trying other delicious combinations: ricotta cheese and spinach or ham and mushrooms, for example. Crespelle are a clever and appetizing idea to tastefully vary the typical Sunday family dishes!
