Pistachios, cherry tomatoes, and short pasta: all of the flavors of the Mediterranean packed into a single recipe. Fusilli pasta with pistachio pesto and cherry tomatoes is an ideal pasta dish to surprise your guests. People often think that pistachios are only used in desserts, but they’re also great in savory recipes and their intense, unique flavor sets off the sweetness of cherry tomatoes to perfection. This very full-bodied sauce needs a pasta shape that can hold it and deliver an explosion of flavor with every forkful. We chose fusilli, but you can pick any pasta shape you like… even lasagna! Fusilli pasta with pistachio pesto and cherry tomatoes is ideal for a summer dinner or quick, tasty Sunday lunch. And to savor the flavor of the pistachios, make sure you choose the one-and-only Bronte pistachios.
