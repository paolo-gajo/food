To prepare potato gattò with soppressata and smoked provola, start by boiling the potatoes in a large pan; check they are done by piercing with a fork (if you want to speed things up you can use a pressure cooker, which will take around 20 minutes) [1]. In the meantime, remove the soppressata from its casing [2] and dice it [3].
Repeat with the smoked provola, then also dice it [4]. As soon as the potatoes are cooked, peel them [5] and mash them up in a bowl using a potato masher [6].
Proceed to make the dough, by adding the softened pieces of butter [7], the grated cheese [8] and the eggs [9]. Lastly, add salt and pepper.
Stir all the ingredients together with a fork or by hand, to create a homogeneous mixture [10]. Place the mixture in a single-use pastry bag and cut off the tip [11]. Now butter a tray, make sure you thoroughly coat the bottom and sides [12].
Sprinkle the breadcrumbs onto the tray [13]. Then begin filling the tray with a first layer of potato cream [14], coating the entire surface; create a raised edge all the way around. When you have finished, add a layer of soppressata [15];
and another of smoked provola [16]. Add another layer of potato cream [17], followed by another layer of soppressata [18]
and smoked provola [19], until all the ingredients are finished. Lastly, you can place any leftover potato cream in a star-tipped pastry bag and use it to add decorative tufts to embellish your dish [20]. In this way you will make your potato gattò with soppressata and smoked provola [21]. Bake in a static oven preheated to 360°F for the first 15 minutes (or bake in a fan-assisted oven at 320°F (160°C)  for 5-8 minutes), then grill at 400°F (205°C) for the last 5 minutes. Remove from the oven when ready and serve the potato gattò hot or warm.
