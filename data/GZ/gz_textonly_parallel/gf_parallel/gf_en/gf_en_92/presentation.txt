The Neapolitan tradition is rich in tasty treats, especially of the sweet variety, such as mostaccioli (soft, cake-like cookies covered in chocolate), amarena cherry cookies, sfogliatelle pastries, and, of course, struffoli, a staple on the dessert table at Christmastime.  If you’ve never heard of struffoli before, all you need to know is that they’re little sweet dough balls that are fried and then dipped in honey and decorated with colored sprinkles and candied fruit. As for the origins of struffoli, we have to go all the way back to the days of the ancient Greeks, who seem to have brought them to the Gulf of Naples at the time of Parthenope. According to many, the name struffoli itself comes from the Greek word strongoulos, meaning “round in shape.” Other theories say the word “struffolo” comes from “strofinare” (“to rub”), which is the movement done by the person working the dough to roll it into a cylinder before cutting it into small pieces. Others still believe that struffoli get their name because they rub and tickle the palate with their sweet taste. Although struffoli are very well known and much loved, they are only really widespread in southern Italy, where you can find different versions that are, in any case, more or less similar to the original: in Calabria, they’re called circata, in Umbria and Abruzzo cicerchiata, and Palermo, strufoli. Today, we’d like to show you how easy it is to make them, with the recipe from the historic Neapolitan coffeehouse Caffè Gambrinus!
