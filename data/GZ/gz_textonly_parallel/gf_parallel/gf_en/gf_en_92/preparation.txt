 
To make the struffoli, start by sifting the flour onto a pastry board [1], then spread it out to form a well in the center [2]. Add the salt [3].
 
Next, add the sugar [4] and baking soda [5]. Cut the butter into cubes and place them in the well [6]. 
 
Start to knead the butter and sugar [7] with your hands, then add the eggs to the well one at a time [8], and keep kneading. Add the egg yolks, too [9].
Now add the anise liqueur [10] and lemon [11] and orange [12] zest.
Start to work the dough with your hands [13] or using a dough cutter to get a smooth, even dough [14]. Once smooth and even, wrap the dough in plastic wrap [15] so it doesn’t dry out. Leave to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Take some of the dough [16], keeping the rest well covered at all times. Roll this dough into cylinders with a diameter of around ? inch (1 cm) [17], then cut them into small pieces around ? inch to ½ inch long (1-1.5 cm) [18].
As you cut the dough into pieces, transfer them to a tray covered with a clean dish towel, leaving space between them [19]. Repeat these steps until all the dough has been formed into these small pieces. Now move on to the frying: Pour the oil into a large pot and heat it to a temperature between 300°F and 320°F (150-160°C). Immerse a few pieces of dough at a time, using a skimmer to help [20], and move them around a little while they’re cooking so they take on a round shape. Drain once they’ve turned nice and golden [21]; this will take around 3-4 minutes.
 
Transfer the fried dough balls to a tray lined with paper towel to drain off the excess oil. Repeat these steps to cook all of the struffoli [22]. Now move on to the decoration. Take the candied orange and cut it into cubes [23]. Place the honey and sugar in a pot [24].
 
Heat over low heat, stirring from time to time [25]. As soon as the mixture begins to boil, turn off the heat. Let it cool and then add the lemon [26] and orange [27] zest.
 
Add the chopped candied orange [28] and stir again [29]. Let it cool for 5-6 minutes, then pour the struffoli into the pot [30].
Stir well with a wooden spoon until the struffoli are coated well and cool [31]. Transfer to a serving dish and decorate with the colored sprinkles [32], candied orange peel, and candied cherries [33]. Your struffoli are ready to enjoy!
