To prepare the black-eyed pea and cabbage salad, start by soaking the black-eyed peas. Then, place them in a container, cover with plenty of water, and let them soak for at least 12 hours [1]. After the time has passed, drain and rinse them. Then, transfer them to a saucepan with plenty of water and bring to a boil [2]. During cooking, you may need to skim off any substances that come to the surface. Allow them to simmer for about 25-30 minutes: they should be firm at the end of cooking (neither too crunchy nor too soft). Then, drain them [3],
and let them cool in a bowl [4]. Meanwhile, move on to the cabbage, slicing it into thin strips [5]. Place it in a bowl along with the salt and sugar [6],
a pinch of black pepper and the juice of 1/2 lemon [7]. Mix well and cover with plastic wrap. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for about 2 hours [8]; this process will allow the cabbage to soften and sweeten in flavor. Then, cut the piece of Parmigiano and reduce it into coarse shavings [9].
pour into the pan over low heat, being careful not to melt them [10]. They should simply become fragrant and 'sweated' on the surface (this step is to enhance the cheese's flavor). Set the shavings aside [11] and peel the mandarins [12].
Transfer the cloves to a bowl, making sure to remove all the white parts [13], and finally, prepare the dressing. In a bowl, pour the honey and the oil [14]. Whisk quickly, adding the salt, to create an emulsion [15].
Now that you have everything ready, proceed with the assembly. Drain the cabbage from the marinade and rinse it [16], place it in a bowl along with the black-eyed peas [17], mandarin segments, and the freshly picked marjoram leaves [18].
Dress with the honey emulsion [19]. Mix everything well and season with salt and pepper to taste. Finally, serve your purple cabbage coleslaw with Parmesan shavings [20], and enjoy your meal [21]!
