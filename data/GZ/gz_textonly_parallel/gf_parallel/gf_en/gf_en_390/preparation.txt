To prepare this delectable tiramisu, start by making the ladyfingers: Pour ½ cup (100 g) of white sugar into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk; cut a vanilla pod lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the blade [1] of a small knife and add to the mixer with the sugar [2]. Add the egg yolks [3] 
and start the mixer at maximum speed [4]. Leave it running for approximately 12 minutes. When the whipped mixture is ready, it will have deep furrows [5]. Now leave it for a moment and move on to whip the egg whites. Whip the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a separate, perfectly clean bowl. Your utensils must also be very clean and the egg whites must be free of traces of yolk. Pour the egg whites into the bowl [6] and start whipping them without sugar.
When they are slightly frothy, add 10% of the remaining ¼ cup (50 g) of white sugar [7] and increase the speed [8], then slowly add the remaining sugar. The egg whites should be smooth and compact. They should also be stiff [9] and not grainy; a grainy appearance is a sign that you have not whipped the egg whites properly and the ladyfingers will not come out as they should.
Mix ½ cup (50 g) of sifted flour and 3 tbsp (30 g) of potato starch [10] in a bowl and sift together [11] to make the mixture more uniform. Now the add the beaten egg whites to the egg yolk mixture [12] using a spatula 
and mix from the bottom up with the spatula [13]; pour in one-third of the sifted powders [14] and mix again gently from the bottom up, then add another third of the egg whites [15]. 
Mix again gently, then add another third of the powdered ingredients [16] and blend; lastly, add the remaining egg whites [17], mix again from the top downwards, and finish by adding the remaining powdered ingredients [18]. Stir the mixture very gently, always working from top to bottom.
Once your whipped mixture is ready [19], take a pastry bag with a ½-inch (14-mm) plain piping tip and transfer the ladyfinger mixture [20] into it with the aid of a dough cutter. It’s better not to use a spatula because you’d end up adding a little mixture at a time, which could cause the mixture to separate. Take a baking sheet and line with parchment paper, then start piping out your ladyfingers to create equally spaced strips [21] measuring approximately 4-5 inches (10-12 cm) long.
Once they’re ready [22], add the seeds of one vanilla bean [23] to the white sugar in a small bowl, and stir to flavor [24]. This will make the ladyfingers even tastier.
Sprinkle the ladyfingers with the flavored white sugar [25] and then dust with plenty of powdered sugar [26]. This will ensure that the sugar creates a steam barrier during cooking and will allow the biscuits to keep their shape; ladyfingers without sugar would turn out flat after cooking. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for approximately 10-11 minutes, taking care to place a thick piece of aluminum foil to wedge the oven door open a little (this will have the same effect as baking with the valve open). Take your ladyfingers out of the oven when the surface is a nice even golden brown [27]. Your home-made ladyfingers are ready and you can leave them to cool. These quantities will make approximately 50 ladyfingers. Once you’ve made your delicious tiramisu, you can eat the leftover ladyfingers as snacks or for breakfast. They can be stored in a tin box.
