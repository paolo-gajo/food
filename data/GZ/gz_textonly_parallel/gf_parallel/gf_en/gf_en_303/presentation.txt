Not a fan of coffee but can't wait to taste a good tiramisu? Today we propose a perfect winter recipe, orange tiramisu! The classic cream based on mascarpone and egg yolks is enriched with whipped cream to make it smoother and with orange zest to make it even more fragrant! Between each layer, a cascade of chocolate will make this tiramisu truly irresistible. To make it, we have chosen to use couple cups, to share during a romantic dinner. If you prefer, you can also serve this tiramisu in smaller portions or in a single dish!
