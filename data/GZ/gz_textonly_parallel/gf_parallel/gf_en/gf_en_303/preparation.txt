To prepare the orange tiramisu, first prepare the cream. In a saucepan, pour 1/2 cup (125 g) of sugar, water [1], and turn on the heat. As soon as the syrup reaches a temperature of 240°F (115°C), pour the egg yolks into the bowl of a stand mixer and begin to beat them with a whisk, adding the remaining 1/4 cup (50 g) of sugar [2]. As soon as the syrup has reached a temperature of 250°F (121°C) [3]
pour it slowly into the stand mixer [4] and continue to beat at medium speed until the mixture is lukewarm [5]. Transfer the mascarpone cheese to a bowl and beat it with a whisk to make it softer. Then pour in the egg yolk mixture [6]
and whisk until obtaining a smooth cream [7]. Add the grated orange zest [8] and mix to incorporate it [9].
Whip the fresh liquid cream from the fridge [10], it should be soft and shiny. Add it to the mascarpone cream [11] and gently mix it with a spatula to incorporate it [12].
Cover the cream with plastic wrap [13] and refrigerate until ready to use. Roughly chop the chocolate and set it aside. Squeeze the oranges to obtain 3/4 cups (180g) of juice. Transfer it to a bowl and add the sugar [15].
Stir with a spoon until the sugar is completely dissolved [16]. Then transfer the cream to a piping bag, there is no need to use a nozzle, simply cut the tip with scissors. Take two glass containers and make a first layer of cream on the bottom [18].
Split the ladyfingers in half [19] and soak two halves in orange juice [21]. Arrange them inside the glass [21]
And cover with the cream. Add some chocolate shavings [22], place two more ladyfinger halves soaked in orange juice on top [23] and continue with another layer of cream and some chocolate [24].
Continue with the final layer: place two soaked ladyfinger halves [25], top with the cream and dust with cocoa powder [26]. Store in the fridge and in the meantime, work on the decoration. Using a peeler, make some strips of orange zest [27];
coat them in granulated sugar [28] and use them to decorate your tiramisu [29]. The orange tiramisu is ready to be served [30].
