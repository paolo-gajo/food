To make octopus salad with parsley, first peel the carrot with a vegetable peeler, then chop it roughly [1]. Do the same with the celery [2]. Put a large pot of water on to boil, and add the chopped carrot, celery, an unpeeled garlic clove, the bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper [3]. 
Rinse the octopus under running water [4] and, once the pot of water is boiling, dip it in the boiling water several times (4-5 will be enough) [5] to get the tentacles to curl [6].
Then immerse the octopus fully and let it cook over medium heat for 40-45 minutes, with the lid on the pot [7]. While the octopus is cooking, use a skimmer to remove any residue and foam that forms on the surface of the cooking water. Once the octopus has finished cooking, let it cool in the cooking water so that it softens. Next, transfer it to a cutting board: Use a knife to remove the eyes [8], then remove the beak as well. Cut across the part where the head is to remove it, then empty it [9].
Cut the tentacles into pieces around ? inch (1 cm) long [10]. Chop the head into small pieces as well and place everything in a bowl. Move on to the dressing: Squeeze the lemon to get 2 tbsp (10 g) of juice [11], then wash, pat dry, and finely chop the parsley, getting rid of the stems [12].
Make the dressing by placing the parsley [13], lemon juice [14], and olive oilÂ  [15] in a small jar (to emulsify it more easily).
Season with salt and pepper [16]. Close the jar [17] and shake it to form an emulsion [18].
Pour the dressing over the octopus [19], mix well [20], and serve your octopus salad with parsley right away [21]!
