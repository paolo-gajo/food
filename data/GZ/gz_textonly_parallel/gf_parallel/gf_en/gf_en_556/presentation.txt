Are you looking for the recipe for batter to write in your notebook so you can show it off any time? Before you do, you have to try some recipes, because there are so many ways to prepare batter! Today we offer you a version with whipped egg whites, which will allow you to obtain a thick mixture that adheres perfectly to vegetables, such as cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant or onions for a golden result. But if you're looking for a gluten-free version don't worry, just replace the flour 00 with rice flour to get an equally tasty result! If, on the other hand, you want a really crispy fried food, go eggless and use just water and flour. Finally, if you prefer a full version, you must absolutely try the beer-based batter we used to fry the gurnard, for example! Choose the right batter for you and to obtain a dry and light fried food pay attention to the type of oil and heat to the right temperature! What are you waiting for? Artichokes, carrots, mushrooms, shrimps, chicken or zucchini are ready to be dipped in this batter and fried! Enjoy them still steaming!
