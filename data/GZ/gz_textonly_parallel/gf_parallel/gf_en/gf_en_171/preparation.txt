To make the risotto all’amatriciana, prepare 2 quarts (2 l) of vegetable broth and keep it warm. Then remove the rind from the guanciale [1] before slicing and cutting into ¼-inch (0.5-cm) strips [2]. Brown the guanciale in a hot pan without adding fat [3], stirring occasionally.
As soon as the guanciale is crispy, add the white wine [4] and simmer until the alcohol evaporates off [5]. Take the peeled tomatoes (with all their juice) and chop or crush them with a fork before adding them to the guanciale [6].
Cook the sauce over medium-low heat with the lid on the pan for about 15 minutes [7], then add salt and pepper to taste. Toward the end of the 15 minutes, toast the rice in a separate pan for a few minutes [8], stirring frequently. Add it to the sauce [9].
Stir to mix the rice into the sauce [10] and start to add the hot vegetable broth [11]. Keep adding a ladleful of broth at a time until the risotto is cooked. This will take about 20 minutes. The final consistency should be creamy [12], and the risotto should roll like a wave if you shake the pan.
Turn off the heat before adding the grated Pecorino cheese [13]. Stir and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving your risotto all’amatriciana piping hot. Add a sprinkle of black pepper [14] and more grated Pecorino cheese to taste [15].
