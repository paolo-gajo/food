Seafood carbonara and cacio e pepe ravioli are just 2 variations of great classic dishes of Lazio. We’ve also discovered a different take on the much-loved pasta all’amatriciana recipe: a creamy risotto with rice taking the place of the traditional rigatoni or bucatini pasta. Risotto all’amatriciana is savory, flavorful, and satisfying. It’s an ideal first course for casual dinners with a few friends, or you could use it to surprise your other half with unmistakable amatriciana aromas in a new twist. We stick to the traditional recipe for our risotto base, but guanciale bacon is the star of the show rather than mushrooms, pumpkin, zucchini, or sausage – naturally accompanied by a sauce of peeled tomatoes. For the ultimate challenge, you could serve a duo of risotto dishes: this amatriciana version paired with a cacio e pepe version!
