The omelette is a dish of French origin, which should not be confused with the classic Italian frittata. It may seem simple to prepare, and actually an omelet is made in just a few minutes, but this recipe can be quite tricky! Today in the Giallozafferano kitchen we had the honor of hosting Cristina Bowerman, a great chef who explained to us how to make the perfect omelet! Starting with the choice of eggs, which must be very fresh, in fact only a superior quality ingredient can transform a simple dish like an omelet into something really special! We then proceed to the cooking, which must be done over a low flame: in fact, by cooking slowly, the egg will be at its softest. But be careful, despite all our advice, you will have to rely on your good judgment and understand when it's the right time to fold the omelette in a crescent shape! That's how you can obtain a light uniform golden color on the outside and a creamy ("drooly") inside. Fill your omelette with cheese or cold cuts, maybe you can also try a vegetable omelette! Serve your omelette with a fruit juice for a healthy and nutritious breakfast! A meal that can give you the right boost all day long... wholesome and complete!
