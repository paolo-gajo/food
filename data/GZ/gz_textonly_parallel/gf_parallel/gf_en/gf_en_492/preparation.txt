To prepare the chickpea soup, start by soaking the chickpeas. Pour them into a large bowl, cover with water [1] and allow to rehydrate for at least 12 hours [2]. After the time has elapsed, warm up a pot of vegetable broth. Meanwhile, drain [2] and rinse the chickpeas. Then clean the leek by removing the two ends [3],
then cutting vertically [4] to eliminate the first two leaves. Finally cut the leek into thin slices [5]. Peel the celery and remove the outer, fibrous part with a potato peeler [6],
then mince it finely [7]. Continue by peeling and chopping the onion [8] and the carrot [9].
Pour the oil into a saucepan, warm it up, and then add the chopped celery, carrot, onion and leek [10]. To soften the vegetables, add a ladle of hot broth [11] and continue cooking for about ten minutes. Add in the chickpeas [12] and let them brown for a few minutes.
Then add bay leaves and rosemary tied with some kitchen twine [13]. Cover the chickpeas with hot vegetable broth [14] and add the tomato puree [15].
Mix and cover the pan with a lid [16]. Cook over low heat for about 2 - 2.5 hours, adding broth as needed. At the end of cooking, remove the herbs [17] and adjust the salt and pepper before serving. Your chickpea soup is ready, and can be accompanied by croutons if you prefer. Enjoy your meal [18]!
