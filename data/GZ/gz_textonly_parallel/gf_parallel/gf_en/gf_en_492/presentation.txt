Some people just cannot say no to soup. It has the power to warm the hands, the body, and last but not least, the heart. Everyone has his or her favorite fromÂ  farmer's soup, probably the classic of the classics, to those with legumes and grains. But among all vegetable, grain and meat-based soups (yes, because there are also seafood soups, like mussel soup), there is one that rises above the others: chickpea soup. It might be the simplest and most humble, but it is the best. Some even say that those looking for cuddles actually want chickpeas, to be enjoyed in a soup or, more simply, with tomato puree. So, calling chickpea soup a dish with a nostalgic allure is absolutely correct, wouldn't you agree? Here is our recipe, let us know if it warmed your heart too.
