To make ricotta and lemon bundt cake, place the eggs and the brown sugar in a bowl [1], add a pinch of salt [2] and beat using an electric whisk [3] for a couple of minutes.
Add the melted butter at room temperature [4] and stir until fully absorbed. Now add the ricotta [5] and continue stirring the mixture [6].
When the mixture is homogeneous, flavor with the lemon zest [7], incorporate the sieved flour [8] and baking powder [9], stir the mixture some more until smooth.
Butter and flour a 9" diameter ring mold with a 4" high edge. Pour the dough in the mold [10] and bake in a static oven at 355°F (180°C) for 50-55 minutes. Once baked, remove the ricotta and lemon bundt cake, leave it to cool [11], remove it from the mold and decorate the surface with a sprinkling of icing sugar [12].
