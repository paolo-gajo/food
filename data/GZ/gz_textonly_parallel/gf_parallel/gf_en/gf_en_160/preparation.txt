To make the saffron risotto, first put the threads in a small glass, pour just enough water [1] to cover them completely, stir [2] and leave to infuse overnight, this way they will release all their color. Next, prepare the vegetable stock. For this recipe you will need one quart. Peel and finely chop the onion [3] so it will dissolve while being cooked and not be detected when tasting the risotto.
In a large saucepan pour 1/4 cup (50 g) of butter from the total amount for this recipe [4], melt it over low heat, then add the chopped onion [5] and let it stew for 10-15 minutes, adding some broth to avoid drying the saut√© [6]: the onion must be transparent and soft.
Once the onion is stewed, pour in the rice [7] and toast it for 3-4 minutes, so that the grains will seal and keep cooking well. Sweat with the white wine [8] and let it evaporate completely. Now proceed with cooking for about 18-20 minutes, adding the stock one ladle at a time, as needed, as it is absorbed by the rice [9]: the grains must always be covered by stock.
Five minutes before the cooking time is up, pour the water with the previously infused saffron threads [10], stir to flavor and dye the risotto to a nice golden color. Once cooked, turn off the heat, add salt [11], stir in the grated cheese and the remaining 1/3 cup (75 g) of butter [12].
Stir and cover with a lid [13]. Let it rest for a couple of minutes. At this point, the saffron risotto is ready [14], garnish the dish with a few more saffron threads, and serve the risotto hot [15].
