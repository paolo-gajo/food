To make the chicken breast with bell peppers, start by peeling the shallot and chopping it finely [1]. Wash the red and yellow peppers, slice them in half [2], then remove the stalk [3] and inner seeds.
Slice the peppers into strips [4] and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large pan and pour in the chopped shallot [5]. Sauté for 1 minute, then add a ladleful of hot water (or vegetable stock) [6] and simmer for a further 3 minutes over low heat.
Once the shallot has softened [7], add the peeled baby plum tomatoes [8] and bell pepper slices [9],
season with salt and pepper to taste [10], cover with a lid [11], and cook over medium heat for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan over very low heat [12], and
 
flour the chicken breast slices [13]. Once the butter begins to sizzle, lay the slices to brown [14] on each side for a few minutes over medium heat, then deglaze with white wine [15] and allow to evaporate.
Cook for a few minutes, just long enough to brown the meat [16]. Once the bell pepper and tomato sauce is ready [17], add the browned chicken breasts [18]. 
Cover with a lid [19], and cook for another 5 minutes over medium heat before removing the lid and continuing to cook for a further 5 minutes over low heat to thicken the sauce a little. Your chicken breast with bell peppers is ready [20] to be served hot [21]!
