 
To make the meat and sausage stuffed peppers, first cut the stale bread into small cubes [1], then place the cubes in a bowl and cover them with the milk [2]. Press the bread cubes lightly so they absorb the milk well. Now move on to the peppers: Wash and dry them [3].
Cut off the tops and remove the pith and seeds [4]. Take the tops, cut around the stem to remove it [5], and then cut the remaining part of the pepper into small pieces [6]. 
Place the ground veal in a large bowl, then remove the casing from the sausage [7] and place the sausage meat in the bowl as well [8]. Take the bread that’s been soaking in the milk and squeeze out the milk well [9].
 
Add the bread to the meat [10] and knead thoroughly [11]. Next, grate the provolone cheese [12]
and add this and the grated Grana Padano to the bowl [13], and knead again using your hands. Now pour in the two eggs [14] and the diced pepper, and knead again [15]. 
Season with salt and pepper [16] and add the chopped parsley [17]. Knead everything well until you get an even mixture. Take the peppers, arrange them in a baking dish and fill them to the top with the meat and sausage filling. Press down with the back of a spoon to ensure the filling is stuffed in well [18]. 
 
Pour over a drizzle of oil [19] and cook the peppers on the middle rack of a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C), for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes have passed, remove the peppers from the oven, sprinkle them with the grated Grana Padano and provolone cheeses [20]. Return the peppers to the oven, placing them under the broiler at 465°F (240°C) for 3-4 minutes. Once the cheese has melted, remove them from the oven, garnish with basil leaves and serve [21].
