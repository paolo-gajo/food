A staple of southern Italian home cooking, stuffed peppers are a delicious, filling dish with a wide range of versions, each more mouth-watering than the last: from vegetarian, filled with a mix of seasonal vegetables, to the rice-stuffed variation that makes for a rich, tasty one-course meal. Thanks to their shape, bell peppers easily turn into delectable shells that can be filled with an appetizing meat-based mixture, softened with bread soaked in milk, just like the way our grandmothers taught us! Baking these stuffed peppers in the oven will ensure that crispy golden crust forms on the top – it will make your mouth water just looking at it!
