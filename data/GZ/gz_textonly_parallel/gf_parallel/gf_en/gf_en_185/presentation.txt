The first time we brought you the most classic and indulgent version with the Nutella roll, then we tried other enticing versions such as the limoncello cream roll and vanilla and strawberry roll for a fresher taste, and we also experimented with a cocoa version with the cocoa roll with white chocolate cream. To show you just how versatile this sweet treat is, today we’re bringing you the ricotta and chocolate chip pumpkin roll, made with a sponge cake enriched with cinnamon-scented pumpkin that gives this version a hint of spice. The filling is as delicious as it is easy to prepare: an orange-scented ricotta cream with the tempting addition of chocolate chips, making it all the more irresistible. If you’re looking for a unique autumnal sweet, look no further and try this ricotta and chocolate chip pumpkin roll.
