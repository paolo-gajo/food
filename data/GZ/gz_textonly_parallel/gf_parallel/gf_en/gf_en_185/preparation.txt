To make the ricotta and chocolate chip pumpkin roll, cut the pumpkin into segments [1] and then arrange them on a tray lined with parchment paper, cover with aluminum foil [2], and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 1 hour (or convection oven at 320°F (160°C) for 50 minutes). Once cooked, take the pumpkin out of the oven and leave to cool, then remove the pulp with a teaspoon [3] or knife and place in the bowl of a food processor.
Add grated nutmeg [4] to taste and the cinnamon [5] and blitz until you get a smooth purée [6], then set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add three whole eggs plus one yolk, plus the honey [7] and half of the sugar [8], and then beat the mixture at medium speed for 10 minutes [9].
Next, add the other half of the sugar [10] and continue beating until it’s absorbed. At this point, turn off the mixer and sift the flour [11] and potato starch [12] into the bowl. 
Finally, add the pumpkin purée, passing it through a strainer [13] and stirring delicately so the mixture stays light and fluffy [14]. Now butter an 11x15-inch (30x40-cm) sheet pan and line it with a sheet of parchment paper. Pour the batter out onto the pan [15]
and distribute it evenly using a spatula [16]; you should get a layer no higher than 2¾ inches (7 mm). Bake the sponge cake in a preheated conventional oven at 390°F (200°C) for 18 minutes (or in a convection oven at 350°F (180°C) for 8-10 minutes). Once baked [17], take the sponge cake out of the oven and turn the pan over onto a surface covered with a sheet of parchment paper so that it’s covered on both the top and bottom [18]. Allow to cool at room temperature for around 1 hour.
In the meantime, make the cream: Pass the ricotta cheese through a strainer [19] at least twice to make it softer, then add the powdered sugar [20] and the grated orange peel [21]. Stir to flavor the ricotta.
When the sponge cake is cool, transfer it to a pastry board, keeping the parchment paper on the bottom and removing the piece on top [22], and spread the ricotta cream all over the surface [23], leaving a ½-inch (1-cm) space from the edges to keep the cream from coming out when the cake is rolled up. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the cream [24], 
then roll up the cake, initially together with the parchment paper to make this step easier [25]. Once you’ve got the roll [26], wrap it in a clean sheet of parchment paper and twist the two ends closed like a candy wrapper [27]. Put the roll in the fridge to cool for at least 2 hours.
After this time, take the roll out, remove the parchment paper [28], and dust the top with the cocoa powder [29]. The ricotta and chocolate chip pumpkin roll is ready to be sliced and served up [30].
