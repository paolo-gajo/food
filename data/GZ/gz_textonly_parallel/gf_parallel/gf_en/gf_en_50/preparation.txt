To prepare the tortellini, first take care of the filling, which will need to rest in the refrigerator for 12 hours. Take the prosciutto and the mortadella, remove the toughest parts, and remove the rind from the prosciutto. Next, roughly chop everything [1], including the loin, into chunks of around the same size. Pass the mixture through the meat grinder on a medium setting [2] and collect the ground meat in a bowl [3]. Don't put the meat grinder away just yet as you'll need it again later on.
Add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano [4], a pinch of salt (not too much, as the filling is already very flavorful, and you can always add more later on), and a pinch of pepper to the ground meat. Start mixing with your hands and add the egg [5], along with the grated nutmeg [6]. Feel free to add plenty of nutmeg, as Bolognese tradition dictates. 
Mix with your hands until the mixture is smooth [7]. Pass the mixture back through the meat grinder, this time on a finer setting [8]. Knead again by hand, cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest in the refrigerator for 12 hours. This allows the flavors and aromas to develop and blend more thoroughly. Once this time has passed, start preparing your egg pasta. Pour the flour onto a pastry board and create the classic well shape [9].
Pour in the lightly beaten eggs [10] and start mixing the ingredients with a fork [11], gradually incorporating the flour from around the edges. Then, knead your dough by hand [12], working from the outside in.
Continue to knead like this, rotating the dough, until the mixture is consistent [13]. Cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature [14]. Once rested, remove the plastic wrap and place the dough on the pastry board [15].
Flatten it with your hands and give it a round shape [16], then roll it out using a long rolling pin [17] until you are left with a very thin sheet [18], so thin that when you lift it up you can see what’s behind it. 
Using a pasta cutter, slice the pasta first into vertical strips [19] and then horizontally [20] to make small squares [21]. The sides of your squares should measure 1 to 1¼ inches (2.5-3 cm) at most.
Place a dollop of filling in the center of each square [22]. Take one, fold it over to form a triangle [23], and press the edges together lightly. Now lower the two side edges, bring together with a sort of pinch [24], and turn the tortellino around your finger.
Seal by pinching the two edges of the dough [25] and your first tortellino is ready [26]. Do the same with all the others, arranging them on a tray with a dish towel [27] as they’re ready. Your homemade tortellini are ready to be cooked in broth or with your favorite sauce!
