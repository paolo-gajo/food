“Beauty is only fleeting, but goodness is forever.” This old Emilian proverb is the perfect introduction to this recipe for the centuries-old favorite: tortellini! Shaping these little gems of of fresh pasta, made with great love and care, is poetry in motion itself – and that’s before we even mention their exquisite flavor. That said, there is a degree of careful calculation involved, too, from the size of the pasta square, which usually varies from 1-2 inches (2.5 to 4 cm), to the weight of the filling, consisting of carefully measured parts of pork loin, mortadella, and prosciutto, and plenty of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Tradition also had it that a certain number of tortellini in broth should fit on the spoon, providing proof of the perfect sizing! The recipe for tortellini, registered with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce and codified by the Brotherhood of the Tortellino, varies to a greater or lesser extent not only between Bologna and Modena, but also from one neighborhood to another and one family to the next. We turned to expert Emilian chef Aurora Mazzucchelli, who, with great skill and passion, showed us how to roll out the fresh pasta with a long rolling pin, as tradition would have it, and how to seal the tortellini before plunging them into the broth. Buon appetito, everyone! If you, too, like to enjoy your tortellini in lots of different ways, why not try making a timbale, frying them, or dressing them with cream and prosciutto, broth, or even just fresh tomatoes!
