To prepare your mozzarella sticks, start with the spicy sauce: Peel and chop the onion [1], then peel and chop the garlic and fresh chili pepper [2]. Add to a saucepan in which you have just heated a little oil [3].
Add the sugar [4] and canned tomatoes [5]. Season with salt [6].
Cover with a lid [7] and cook for about 15 minutes. Once it’s cooked for long enough, the sauce will thicken. Pour in the cream [8] and cook for a few moments, stirring from time to time. Then turn off the heat and blitz everything with an immersion blender [9].
Leave to cool [10]. In the meantime, cut the mozzarella into rectangular sticks weighing 1 oz (20 g) each [11]; you should end up with 12 with the quantities in the recipe. Prepare 3 small bowls: Place the flour in one bowl, the lightly beaten eggs in another, and the breadcrumbs and cornflakes [12] in the last one.
Lightly salt the eggs [13]. Dip each stick in the flour [14], then coat completely in the egg [15].
Lastly, coat the sticks with the breadcrumb and cornflake mixture (16-17). Repeat these steps, dipping the mozzarella first into the egg and then into the breadcrumbs and cornflakes [18] to get a double coating.
Now you’re ready to fry in hot oil at 340°F (170°C) for a couple of minutes. Fry one or two sticks at a time so the oil temperature doesn’t go down too much [19]. Once the sticks are golden brown, drain with a slotted spoon [20] and place on a sheet of absorbent paper to get rid of any excess oil. Serve the mozzarella sticks with the spicy sauce [21].
