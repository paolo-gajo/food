To make the winter panzanella, first clean and thinly slice the red onion [1]. Also cut the red cabbage into thin strips, after removing the outer leaves and the central core [2], and proceed in the same way with the fennel [3].
Peel the pumpkin and cut it into small cubes (you should get about 150 g) [4]. Tear the bread slices into pieces with your hands inside a large bowl [5]. Moisten with water [6]
and balsamic vinegar [7]. Mix, cover with plastic wrap, and let it marinate. Meanwhile, continue with the preparation: heat a bit of oil in a pan and add the pumpkin [8]. Sauté the pumpkin over high heat for about 3 minutes, it should be well browned [9].
Set aside the pumpkin and in the same pan, heat another drizzle of oil. This time, add the red cabbage [10] and sauté it for 5 minutes [11]. Then, take the soaked bread and add all the prepared ingredients: the onion [12],
fennel [13], olives, making sure to pit them with a small knife [14], and finally add the pumpkin [15] and the sautéed cabbage to the mix.
 
Flavored with stems of chives cut into small pieces [16], seasoned with oil [17], salt, and pepper to taste. Your winter panzanella is ready to be enjoyed [18]!
