Who hasn't heard of beef fillet with green peppercorn sauce? Even if you don’t remember the unforgettable ’80s, which brought us some pretty dubious looks and hairstyles, along with timeless classic dishes such as shrimp cocktail and pennette pasta with salmon and vodka, beef fillet with green peppercorn sauce is the sort of classic that is still popular today, especially among meat lovers! This fine cut of beef, which has to be of the best quality since it’s the main ingredient in the recipe, is served drenched in a sauce flavored with green peppercorns that brings a real creaminess and balance to the dish. The sauce itself, made with cream and Dijon mustard, hints at the French origin of this sophisticated dish, although its apparent simplicity actually conceals a few potential pitfalls that can nevertheless be avoided by following our instructions, ensuring that you get the perfect result. The meat in this dish is best cooked rare, but if you’re not a fan of raw meat we recommend that you at least leave the inside nice and pink. Perfect for a romantic dinner or a dinner party with friends, beef fillet with green peppercorn sauce is a contemporary main course with a delightfully retro feel!
