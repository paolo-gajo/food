To prepare clementine sponge cake, wash and dry the clementines. Then take 10 oz from the total amount and coarsely chop it up, without removing the peel (1-2). Peel the remaining clementines [3],
divide each one in half [4]. Now place the peeled clementines and unpeeled coarsely chopped ones in the mixer, along with the yogurt [5], eggs [6],
sugar [7], seed oil [8], flour [9] and
baking powder [10]. Now put the lid on and thoroughly blend all the ingredients together [12].
Butter and flour a baking pan (13-14). Pour the mixture into the pan [15]
and place in a conventional oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) [16] and bake for around 75 minutes (after the first 30 minutes, if you notice the surface darkening too quickly, cover it with some parchment paper and continue baking). Once baked, remove from the oven and leave the clementine sponge cake to cool before removing from the pan [17]. Serve it alone or with a nice sprinkle of powdered sugar!
