To prepare fried mozzarella and anchovy skewers, start by slicing the mozzarella for pizza [1]. Then drain the anchovies in oil. Take a long slice of sandwich bread, lay the slices of mozzarella [2], trimming them to have a uniform layer [3].
Lay some anchovy fillets [4] and cover with another slice of bread [5]. Continue with slices of mozzarella and anchovy fillets [6].
Close with another slice of bread [7]. Now you can skewer the shorter side with 4 skewers to obtain the first 4 skewers (8-9) and continue like this until everything has been used.
Pass the skewers first in milk [10], then in beaten eggs [11], and finally in breadcrumbs [12].
Proceed to the double breadcrumbs dipping once again the skewers already breaded first in eggs [13] and then in breadcrumbs [14]. Heat the peanut seed oil in a pan to 300° F (150° C). Fry a few pieces at a time [15] to avoid overheating the oil.
Remove when they are golden [16]: it will take a few minutes. Place them on absorbent paper to remove the excess oil [17] and serve your fried mozzarella and anchovy skewers hot [18].
