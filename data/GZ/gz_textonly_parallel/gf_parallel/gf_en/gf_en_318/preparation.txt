To prepare nut crunch, start by chopping the nuts: place the pine nuts, pistachios, almonds and hazelnuts [1] on an oven tray, spread them over the entire surface [2] and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 5 minutes. Once toasted, place the nuts on a cutting board, add the walnut kernels too [3]
and coarsely chop with a knife [4]. Place the chopped nuts in a bowl, add the sesame seeds [5], and stir. Now make the caramel: place the water and sugar in a saucepan [6],
add the lemon juice [7], stir with a spoon [8] and dissolve the mixture on a medium flame: it will take around 20 minutes. Take a square 8" (20 cm) bottomless mold and place it on an oven tray lined with parchment paper [9].
Grease the inner edge of the mold with oil [10]. In the meantime the syrup will have turned into the right consistency: it should be amber in color and bubbles will start to surface [11]. Now add the nuts [12]
and stir to amalgamate [13]; leave to cook for another 2/3 minutes. Pour the mixture into the mold [14], spread it evenly using a wood spoon [15]
Leave it to cool at room temperature for around 10 minutes (it will still be soft and malleable). Once the resting time is up, before removing the mold, run the blade of a knife along the entire edge [16] so that it will be easier to remove the mixture from the mold (17-18).
Tip the nut crunch over onto a cutting board, remove the parchment paper [19], cut it into 8 pieces of equal size [20] and leave to rest until the bars take on a compact and hardened consistency. Place the nut crunch on a serving dish; it is now ready to be enjoyed [21]!
