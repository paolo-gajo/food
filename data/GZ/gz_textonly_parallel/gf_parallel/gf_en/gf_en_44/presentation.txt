No matter how you make them – poached, stuffed, baked with leeks, soft or hard-boiled – eggs always make a tasty meal. Today’s recipe is a traditional home-cooked treat: uova alla contadina. Simple is best! A homely pot with a generous splash of tomato passata to envelop the eggs, flavorings to taste, a layer of string cheese and that’s it. Eggs have never been so tasty! Uova alla contadina is a frugal dish and countless varieties have been handed down through the generations, each family adding their own new twist: Some make the dish in a frying pan, some leave out the cheese and some add onion. The only rule is that the eggs must be intact, otherwise let your imagination run free!
