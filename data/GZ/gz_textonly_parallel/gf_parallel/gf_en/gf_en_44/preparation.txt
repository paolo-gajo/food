To make uova alla contadina, first cut the tomino cheese into cubes [1], then take an ovenproof dish and spread a layer of tomato passata over the base [2]. Add a little oil [3].
Now add one egg at a time [4] to the pan. We recommend breaking the egg into a small bowl first to make sure you keep the yolk intact. Arrange the 4 eggs side by side [5] and spread the remaining tomato puree [6] over the top, seasoning with salt and pepper.
Add the cubes of tomino cheese [7] and flavor with the rosemary sprigs [8]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 20-25 minutes, depending on how hard you like your eggs. When your uova alla contadina is done, take the dish out of the oven and serve piping hot [9].
