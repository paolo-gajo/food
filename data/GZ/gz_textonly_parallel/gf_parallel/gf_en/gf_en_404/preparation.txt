To make your fusilli bucati with radicchio sauce, first bring a pan of salted water to a boil for cooking the pasta. Cut off the base of the spring onion [1], wash it and slice it into strips [2], taking care to discard the green part. Heat the oil in a pan and pour in the sliced spring onion [3].
Allow to brown for a couple of minutes, then dilute with a couple of ladles of the pasta water [4] and continue cooking for around 10 minutes or until wilted. In the meantime, remove the base of the radicchio, wash the leaves and cut them into strips [5]. Pour the radicchio into the pan with the spring onion [6],
season with salt and pepper [7], and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. In the meantime, take the pasta, pour it into the boiling water [8] and cook for around 10 minutes or the time stated on the package. Once the radicchio is cooked [9],
use the ladle to take out two-thirds of the sauce and transfer it to a tall-sided glass [10]. Pour in the light cream [11] and blend the mixture with an immersion blender [12]
until you get a smooth cream [13]. By now, your pasta will be cooked. Drain and pour it straight into the pan with the sauce [14], stir [15], 
season with the thyme leaves [16], and add the grated pecorino [17]. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir to enhance the flavors, and serve your fusilli bucati with radicchio sauce piping hot [18].
