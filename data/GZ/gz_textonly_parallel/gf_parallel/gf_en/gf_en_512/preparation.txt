To make the cavatelli, add the semolina and salt to a bowl and stir to combine[1]. Pour the water in slowly as you knead with your hands [2], continuing like this until the flour has absorbed all the water [3].
At this point, transfer the dough to a pastry board and work it for 5-10 minutes, folding it over itself to make it smooth [4]. Shape the dough into a small ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature [5]. Take one portion from the ball of dough [6]
Roll out this portion, creating a sausage shape around ¼ inch (6-7 mm) thick [7]. Then cut this into pieces of around ?-½ inch (1 cm) [8]. Use the long part of your thumb to help press down [9] and, 
at the same time, drag the piece of dough forward [10]: This is how you’ll get the first cavatello [11]. You can also make them using your middle finger or pinkie. Keep dusting them with semolina so they don’t stick, and arrange them on a tray as you form them [12]. Now your cavatelli are ready to be cooked and dressed with the sauce of your choice!
