You can make so many tasty things just using water and flour! Fresh pasta, in all its forms, is one of these and is a great starting point for getting your creative juices flowing. Today, we’re bringing you a recipe for cavatelli, a type of fresh pasta made using semolina and no eggs that’s typical in the regions of Molise and Apulia, and also found elsewhere throughout southern Italy. An expert pair of hands and a bit of patience are all that’s needed to create these special little dumplings, which get their name from the fact that they have a little cavo, or hollow, in the middle, formed by lightly pressing your finger on the small piece of dough. With just a few ingredients and a bit of practice, you’ll be able to proudly bring your homemade pasta to the table. Cavatelli go perfectly with a wide range of sauces: tomato and ricotta salata, creamy potato and speck, or even a tasty seafood sauce.
