The Mimosa cocktail, a light and refreshing drink made with orange juice and sparkling wine, is beloved around the world. The original Mimosa was concocted by a bartender at the Ritz Hotel in Paris in 1925. This cocktail was named after the yellow mimosa flower, which it resembled in color. Interestingly, a few years earlier in London, an almost identical cocktail emerged, known as the Buckâ€™s Fizz, named after the bar where it was created. In Italy, the Mimosa is considered an aperitif, but in the United States, it's a popular choice for Sunday brunches, serving as a 'bubbly' alternative to orange juice. It pairs wonderfully with French toast and maple syrup pancakes. Will you try this idea at your next brunch?
