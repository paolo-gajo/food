To prepare the Mimosa, squeeze the orange - about half of it [1] - and pour the juice into a flute glass [2]. Then add well-chilled Brut sparkling wine (spumante) [3].
From the remaining orange, cut out a crescent-shaped slice [4], and make a small incision in the slice so you can place it on the rim of the glass [5]. Your Mimosa cocktail is now ready to be enjoyed [6]!
