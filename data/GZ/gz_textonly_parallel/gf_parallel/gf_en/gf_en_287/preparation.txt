To make panna cotta, first soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for 10-15 minutes [1]. Cut the vanilla pod lengthwise and extract the seeds by scraping with the tip of a knife [2]. Put the liquid cream in a saucepan, then pour in the sugar [3].
Flavor with the vanilla seeds [4] and also add the pod [5]; heat everything over a low heat, but without boiling; when it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and extract the pod using kitchen tongs [6].
When the gelatin is softened, drain it without squeezing excessively [7], then dip it in the pot with hot cream [8]. Stir with a wooden spoon or hand whisk until the gelatin has completely dissolved; there must be no lumps. At this point take 4 five-ounce molds  and pour in the panna cotta using a ladle[9].
Once the molds are filled [10], put the panna cotta in the refrigerator to set for at least 5 hours. Once it has set [11], before serving it and for better demolding, dip each mold into boiling water for a few seconds [12]. 
then immediately demold the panna cotta on each serving plate [13]: serve your panna cotta au natural [14], with caramel, melted chocolate, or fruit coulis [15].
