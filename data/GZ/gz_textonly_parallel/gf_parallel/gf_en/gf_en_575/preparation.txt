To prepare the avocado hummus, start with the avocado: cut it vertically [1], then divide it in half [2] and finally remove the stone ( 3).
Peel the avocado [4] and finally cut it into cubes [5]: you will have to obtain about 1 lb (450 g) of avocado pulp. Squeeze a lemon with a juicer [6]
and filter the juice with a colander, collecting it in a small bowl [7]. Take the mixer and pour in the drained the precooked chickpeas [8] and diced avocado [9].
Add the peeled garlic [10], the tahini [11] and the filtered lemon juice [12]. Salt and pepper.
Finally, pour the oil [13] and turn the mixer on at medium speed, blending until you get a smooth cream without lumps [14]. Transfer the avocado hummus to a serving bowl, adding a pinch of black and white sesame seeds [15]. Your avocado hummus is ready to be enjoyed!
