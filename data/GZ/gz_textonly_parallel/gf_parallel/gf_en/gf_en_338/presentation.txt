On the 8th March we have always paid tribute to women in the most delicious of ways! From the classic mimosa cake, with its delicious pineapple version, to the creative tagliatelle that evoke mimosa leaves. Lots of tempting recipes, each characterized by the typical straw yellow color of the traditional symbol of women's day. The recipe for mimosa cupcakes is the latest addition to a rich collection inspired by this occasion, for a single-portion version of the eponymous cake. With their creamy diplomat cream, these cupcakes make the perfect small gift for celebrating this special day!!
