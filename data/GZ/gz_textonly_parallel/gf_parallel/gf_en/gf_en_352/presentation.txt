In the springtime, strawberry desserts are always the most appreciated ones. For anyone who fancies something fresh, nothing quite hits the spot like a nice semifreddo, and for those with a sweeter tooth, pairing the fruit with chocolate is a must; but what makes everyone truly happy is this mascarpone and strawberry cake. A scenographic dessert that is perfect for special occasions and days in which you need to relax by spending a little time in the kitchen. Mascarpone and strawberry cake is perfect for celebrating a birthday or for preparing together with mum on occasion of her special day! Three layers of sponge, interspersed with a velvety cream with fresh strawberries. With its simplicity and inviting appearance, no one will be able to resist!
