To prepare mascarpone and strawberry cake, start by making the sponge. Place the eggs, at room temperature, in the bowl of a planetary mixer, together with the sugar [1]. Then start to beat them on a medium speed [2] and in the meantime, sieve the flour together with the potato starch [3].
After whisking the eggs [4], add the powders [5] and delicately stir from the bottom upwards, to avoid deflating the mixture, until fully absorbed.
Add the almond flour [7] and stir delicately once more, to create a homogeneous and frothy mixture. Pour it into a 7 inch (18 cm) diameter mold that is 4 inches (10 cm) tall (8-9).
Delicately smooth the surface, without tapping the mold on the worktop. Now [10] bake in a static oven on the middle shelf at 347°F (175°C) for 33 minutes. Once this time is up, check it is done using the toothpick test; remove the cake from the oven if ready [11]. Wait a few minutes and while still hot, remove from the mold and turn it over onto a grille. Leave to cool thoroughly [12].
In the meantime prepare the dip. Place the water and sugar in a pan [13], add the peel of half a lemon and half an orange [14]. Heat until the sugar fully dissolves. Now filter [15] and leave to cool in a bowl.
Once the sponge cake has fully cooled, start to make the cream for the filling. Place the cream in a bowl, add the seeds of half a vanilla bean [16] and the powdered sugar [17]. Beat with an electric whisk into a firm and frothy cream [18].
Place the mascarpone in another bowl and stir a little with a spatula to soften it. Now gradually add the whipped cream [19] and once more stir from the bottom up so as not to deflate the mixture [20]. Place half of the cream inside a pastry bag with a striped 1/2 inch (1 cm) tip [21] and place both creams in the refrigerator until you are ready to use them.
Now take the sponge cake, which will have cooled by now, and remove the outer crust on the surface using a long knife with a serrated blade. Cut out three discs of equal thickness by sliding the blade of the knife parallel to the worktop (23-24).
Now prepare the strawberries: delicately wash, hull [25] and dice them [26]. Now all you need to do is assemble the dessert. Place the sponge base on a plate, even better if a rotating one. Take the soak and dab it onto the cake base using a brush [27].
Use the pastry bag to apply half of the cream over the entire surface of the cake [28], add half of the strawberries [29] and cover with a second sponge cake disc. Once more, cover the new base with the soak [30],
add the remaining cream in the pastry bag and evenly distribute the strawberries over it. Place the last disc on top [31] and apply the soak [32]. Use the remaining cream to cover the entire outer edge [33].
Smooth with a spatula to fully coat the cake [34]. Place back in the refrigerator and in the meantime, beat the cream with the powdered sugar [35]. Cover the entire cake, once more using a spatula [36].
Once smooth and entirely covered [37], place the remaining cream in a pastry bag with a striped tip [38], Wash the strawberries and cut each one into four pieces [39].
Now coat the entire lower edge of the cake in the ground pistachio, to create a decorative effect on the base only (40-41). Squeeze a few tufts of leftover cream onto the surface [42].
Arrange the sliced strawberries on top [43] and garnish with the ground pistachios [44]. Now place in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve your mascarpone and strawberry cake [45].
