To prepare your parmigiana sandwich, start with the sauce. Heat a little oil together with a peeled clove of garlic in a saucepan [1]. After a few moments, add the tomato puree [2], followed by the basil leaves. Stir, cover with a lid, and leave to cook on low heat for around 25 minutes [3].
Allow the sauce to thicken, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. Once cooked, remove the garlic and add salt to taste [4]. Meanwhile, prepare the eggplants. First, wash and dry them, then slice them to a thickness of ?” (2-3 mm) to obtain exactly 20 round slices [5]. Heat a good glug of vegetable oil in a saucepan, and once it reaches 340°F (170°C) (we recommend using a thermometer to check), immerse a few pieces into the oil at a time [6].
Once golden brown, which should take 1-2 minutes, drain the slices on paper towel [7]. Next, move on to the bread. Cut the rolls in half using a serrated knife [8], then set the tops aside and remove a good part of the crumb [9] from the inside of the base.
Now for the filling. Start by pouring a little sauce into the hollowed-out base [10], then place 3 slices of eggplant inside [11], trying to leave a little space in the middle [12] as you do so.
Continue with a little more sauce [13], a spoonful of Parmigiano [14], and then two more slices of eggplant [15].
Top with basil [16], more tomato [17], and cheese [18].
Gradually transfer the stuffed rolls onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper [19], add the tops separately and sprinkle them with Parmigiano cheese [20]. Bake in a hot oven at 390°F (200°C) for around 10 minutes, then switch to broil mode at 460°F (240°C) for a couple of minutes [21].
Only brown the bread; do not let it burn [22]. Finally, place the tops back onto the filled halves [23] and your parmigiana sandwiches are ready to serve [24].
