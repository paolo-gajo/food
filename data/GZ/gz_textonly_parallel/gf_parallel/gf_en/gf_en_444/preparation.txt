To make the desert rose cookies, put the room-temperature (so fairly malleable) butter in a bowl along with the sugar [1], salt [2], and vanilla extract [3], and stir with a spatula until you get a creamy mixture.
Add the eggs one by one (4(. Sift the flour [5], then add this to the bowl and stir to combine [6]. 
Next, sift the baking powder into the bowl [7], followed by the almond flour [8] and crumbled cornflakes [9]. Stir again to combine.
Take a spoonful of dough [10] and dredge in whole cornflakes [11], turning the dough so that it’s covered, and compacting it slightly [12].
Repeat these steps until you’ve used up all the dough, transferring the little raw cookie balls to a tray [13] as you make them. Once all the balls are formed, place the tray in the fridge for around 20 minutes before baking the cookies. Arrange the desert rose cookies on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper [14] and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C), for around 15 minutes. When you take them out of the oven, they’ll seem slightly undercooked but, once cooled, they’ll be perfect! Sprinkle your desert rose cookies with powdered sugar [15] before serving.
