Desert rose cookies are tasty treats that get their name thanks to their unusual shape that recalls the flowers of the same name. A sweet copy of nature, these appealing and delectable cookies also recall Carnival roses, the fragrant little fried dough flowers eaten around this holiday. Once the desert rose dough is ready, the cookies get a crunchy cornflake coating. This is the fun little trick that gives them the irregular profile they share with the eponymous flowers. The result is an amazing combination of textures: Crispy on the outside with a crumbly almond shortbread on the inside, these little homemade cookies will win you over with just one bite. Once you put these delicious sweet treats out on the table, they wonâ€™t last for long!
