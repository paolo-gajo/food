To prepare potato croquettes, wash the potatoes under running water to remove soil residue [1], place them unpeeled in a large saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil [2]: to cook them evenly, use similar sized potatoes as much as possible. It will take about 40 minutes if you boil them or about half that time with a pressure cooker. Once ready, let them cool down slightly (just enough to be able to handle them) and peel them [3].
Pass them through a potato masher to obtain a puree while they are still hot [4]; in a separate bowl, beat the yolks with pepper and salt [5] then add them to the potato puree [6]
flavor with grated nutmeg [7] and season with grated cheese [8], stir with a spoon to mix the ingredients to obtain a soft and dry mixture. Take about 1/4 cup of mixture [9] and shape into a croquette,
giving it a cylindrical shape, slightly pressing both ends. As you make the croquettes, place them on a tray covered with baking paper [10]. This recipe will yield about 30 croquettes. Once you've used up the mixture, proceed to bread the croquettes: beat the two eggs in one bowl and place the breadcrumbs in another. Pass the croquettes first in the egg [11], then in the breadcrumbs [12].
Place the croquettes on a tray covered with baking paper. Once all the croquettes are finished, heat plenty of peanut oil in a medium size pan until it reaches 350°F (180-190°C) (we recommend the use of a kitchen thermometer for best results). Dip 3-4 croquettes in the oil at a time so as not to lower the temperature of the oil too much [13]. Cook them by turning them over with a skimmer [14] until they are well browned on all sides. Drain them and put them on a plate lined with absorbent paper to drain excess oil [15]. Serve the potato croquettes while they're still hot!
