To prepare hard-boiled eggs, begin by placing the eggs in a saucepan with cold water [1]; ensure the water covers the eggs. Place the saucepan on the heat and bring it to a boil, then cook for 9 minutes over medium heat [2]. After this time, drain the eggs and cool them under running water or transfer them to a bowl filled with ice water [3].
Lightly tap the tip on the counter to crack the shell [4], then gently peel off the shell [5]. Your hard-boiled eggs are ready to be enjoyed however you like [6]!
