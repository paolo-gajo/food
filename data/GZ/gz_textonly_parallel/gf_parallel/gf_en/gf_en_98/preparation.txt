Let's start from the base of your strawberry cheesecake: melt the butter over low heat, or in the microwave, and let it cool. Pour the cookies, brown sugar [2] into the mixer and blend until completely crumbled [2]. Transfer to a bowl and add the melted butter [3].
Mix well [4] until you get a homogenous mixture. Line the base of a 8 inch (20 cm) diameter pan lined with parchment paper and with a strip of acetate on the edges [5]. If you do not have acetate, you can also use parchment paper. Pour the cookies mixture in it [6].
Compact well with the help of the back of a spoon [7], for a uniform thickness [8]. Place the base in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Meanwhile, take care of the cream: wash the strawberries and remove the leaves [9].
Transfer them to the mixer [10] and blend them until you get a sauce [11]. Sift the sauce obtained to remove any seeds [21].
Keep your strawberry sauce aside [13]. Pour the ricotta and mascarpone into a bowl [14], then mix with a spatula to soften the cream.
Sift the powdered sugar a little at a time on the cream [16] and mix until it is completely absorbed [17]. Soak the gelatin in cold water [18] and wait a couple of minutes.
Heat the cream on the stove [19]. When the cream starts to boil, turn off the heat. Squeeze the gelatin [20] and pour it into the cream [21].
Stir with a spoon or a whisk [22], until completely dissolved and let it cool. In the meantime, pour the strawberry sauce in the cheese cream [23]. Mix until you get a cream with a homogeneous color.
Pour the warm cream and gelatin mixture [25] and mix well, to incorporate it with the rest of the ingredients [26]. Take the base out of the fridge and pour the cream on top [27].
Using a spatula [28] level the surface [29] well. Transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Once ready, take the cheesecake from the fridge and widen the mold ring to remove it [30].
Transfer to a serving dish and remove the acetate on the edges [31]. Decorate with fresh strawberries [32] and crumbled biscuits [33]. Strawberry cheesecake is ready to serve.
