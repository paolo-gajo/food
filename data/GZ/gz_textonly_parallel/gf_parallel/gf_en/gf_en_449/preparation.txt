To prepare crostata amalfitana (lemon custard and sour cherry tart), pour the flour, baking powder [1] and the cold, chopped butter [2] into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a spatula. Mix for a few minutes, then add the sugar [3].
and the salt [4]. Start the machine again to obtain a floury and crumbled mixture, then flavor with the rind of half a lemon [5] and pour in the eggs [6],
knead until the dough is compact and well-blended [7]. Then put the dough on the work surface, knead it lightly with your hands into a loaf [8] and cover with plastic wrap [9]. Let it rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
In the meantime, prepare the custard: pour the yolks [10] and sugar [11] into a small saucepan, stir with a spatula and then add the flour [12].
Mix until smooth and thick [13], then set aside. Now pour the milk into a saucepan [14], flavor it with lemon zest [15] and heat it on the stove.
When it starts to boil, pour a small amount on the egg mixture, stirring with a spatula [16], then add the rest and blend. Transfer the saucepan over the heat [17] and let the cream thicken over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it is creamy and thick [18].
Transfer the cream into a bowl [19], fill a larger bowl with ice cubes [20] and place the cream on top [21].
Cover it with plastic wrap [22], this way it will cool down quickly without losing color and texture. Once it's cold, let it cool in the fridge for an hour. Once the necessary time has passed, take 2/3 of the shortcrust dough [23] and roll it out with a rolling pin [24]
to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm) [25]. Transfer the sheet obtained to a 9 1/2-inch (24 cm) round mold, preferably with a removable bottom [26]. Make the pastry stick well to the bottom and sides, then cut off the excess dough around the top [27].
Fill the tart with the cream and spread it evenly with a spatula [28]. Drain the sour cherries from their syrup [29] and scatter them over the cream [30].
Take the rest of the dough and the pieces of dough [31], roll them out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1/8 inch (3 mm) [32] and cut out strips about 1/3-inch (1 cm) wide [33].
Lay the strips on the tart in a slanted direction, overlapping them to create a lattice pattern (34-35). Cut off the excess dough around the edges with a knife [36].
Once you have finished decorating [37], bake the tart in a static oven on the middle shelf at 360°F (180°C) for 35 minutes. When it is cooked, remove the crostata amalfitana (lemon custard and sour cherry tart) from the oven [38], let it cool down, then unmold it and serve it dusted with powdered sugar [39].
