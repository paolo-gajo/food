With the recipe of crostata amalfitana (lemon custard and sour cherry tart), we make a trip to Campania, land of pastiera, sfogliatelle and many other delicacies with timeless flavors, recipes jealously guarded by this region. It is not a typical preparation, but a cake that takes its name probably because of the ingredients used and combined. A soft and fragrant shortcrust contains a lemon-flavored custard that hides gems of sweetness: amarena cherries. Cream and amarena cherries are in fact one of the classic combinations of southern sweets, particularly treats from Apulia (just think of pasticciotti) and Campania... A pair that we know well in cream-filled zeppole decorated with sour cherries; we had pleasantly discovered it in polacca aversana and we did not miss the opportunity to enrich our delicious dessert list with this tart with fresh and intense aromas that evoke the scents of the Amalfi Coast.
