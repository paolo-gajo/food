To make Genoese pesto, first remove the basil leaves from the stems and place them in a colander [1]. Rinse quickly under cold running water [2], then transfer them to a dish towel and dry them by blotting and rubbing gently [3]. Pay attention to the leaves’ concave shape as water can pool in them; the leaves must be nice and dry.
Remove the germ from the garlic cloves and cut them in half [4], then place in a marble mortar. Work the garlic with a wooden pestle until you get a cream [5]. At this point, add the pine nuts [6] and continue to grind.
Once a paste has formed [7], add the basil leaves [8] and coarse salt [9].
Always start with pounding movements, then moving on to circular movements [10]. Make sure you scrape around the inside of the mortar with a spoon to unstick the ingredients; that way, you’ll get an even pesto. Once the consistency is creamy and even, add the pecorino [11], in chunks, and grind in the same way to incorporate it, then add the Parmigiano Reggiano [12], doing the same.
When all the ingredients have been reduced to a cream, pour in the oil [13] and circle the pestle around for a couple of more minutes [14]. Your genoese pesto is ready to be used [15]!
