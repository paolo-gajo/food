To make the pie, first wash and dry the potatoes with their peel, then slice them thinly with a mandolin [1] and store them in a bowl full of water to prevent them from blackening. Take the courgette flowers and cut off the stem [2], detach the leaves from the base of the flower. To remove any earth residues inside the flower, gently wipe with a small brush. Open the flower and remove the pistil [3].
Cut the fontina cheese into cubes [4] and set aside. Now drain the potato slices and dry them with a cloth [5], heat a non-stick pan and arrange a first layer of potatoes on the spiral bottom, lay the potatoes overlapping them [6]
once you have made a circle [7] place a potato in the center [8] so that there are no empty spaces between the slices. Sprinkle the whole surface with part of the pecorino [9].
Cover with the lid [10] and heat for about 2-3 minutes. Distribute another layer of potatoes in a spiral [11] as you did previously, continue with a layer of pecorino [12]
so as to cover the entire surface [13]. Now stuffed with half of the sliced cooked ham [14], half of the zucchini flowers [15]
also distribute half a dose of fontina cubes [16]. Continue with the remaining dose of cooked ham [17] and the remaining zucchini flowers [18]
top it with the remaining cubes of fontina and more pecorino [19]. Cover with a lid [20] and let everything cook for about 10 minutes. Serve the potato pie in the pan immediately [21], so as to enjoy it still racy!
