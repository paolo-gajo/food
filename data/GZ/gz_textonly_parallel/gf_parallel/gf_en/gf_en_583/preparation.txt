To prepare the apricot jam tart, first you need to make the shortcrust pastry. Pour the soft but still pliable butter into the bowl of a food processor bowl fitted with a spatula. Add the powdered sugar [1], the seeds scraped off a vanilla bean [2] and the grated lemon rind [3].
 
Start the machine at low speed, add the honey [4]. In a separate bowl, pour the yolks and salt [5], stir to dissolve it [6].
Add the mixture to the bowl of the food processor [7] and when you have obtained an even mixture, turn off the machine and incorporate the flour sifted twice [8], stirring consistently at low speed. You should knead the dough as little as possible: it should be soft, but not sticky [9].
 
Next, lightly flour the work top and transfer the shortcrust pastry, with the help of a rubber spatula. Add a little more flour [10] and without kneading, give it a brick-like shape. Cover with plastic wrap [11] and place in the refrigerator to become firm, possibly overnight. This will stabilize the dough and make it much easier to knead. You can then move on to make the pie. Pour the jam into a bowl, add the lemon zest [12]
and stir with a rubber spatula or a spoon [13]. Take the shortcrust pastry from the fridge, remove the plastic wrap and place it on a lightly floured surface. Add a little more flour on top of the shortcrust pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin to a 1/8-inch (3.5 mm) thickness [14]. The thickness should be uniform, check the dough for the presence of thicker areas. Now cut the dough using an 8-inch (21 cm) ring [15].
Place the ring with the dough inside on a drip pan lined with baking paper [16] and pierce with a fork 817). Pour the jam on the pastry disk and spread it with the back of a spoon, leaving a 1/2-inch (1 cm) edge.
 
Cut strips from the leftover dough. Creating the lozenge lattice is important because it prevents the jam from burning, so the tart will bake perfectly. Add a little more flour on top of the dough and slightly press with a rolling pin, as the strips should be slightly thinner than the disc. To cut them out, use a rolling pin and a plain pastry wheel cutter [19]. Place the strips on the tart first in one direction and then in the other, in order to create the lozenges, eliminating any excess dough with your fingers [21].
 
Using the remaining shortcrust pastry, create a 3/4-inch (2 cm) thick stick [22] and place it on the entire edge of the tart [23]. Press it lightly with your fingertips. Use the handle of a spoon to make indentions on the entire edge [24].
This way you will join the two parts of dough and at the same time create a pattern [25]. Now bake the tart in a static oven at 330°F (165°C) for 45 minutes on the lower shelf. When the pie is a nice golden color, take it out of the oven and let it cool before removing the ring [26]. Once completely cooled, you can serve your apricot jam tart [27].
