Peel and grate the zucchini using a coarse grater [1] and then add them to a bowl [2]. Transfer the bread to a food processor [3] 
and blend to make breadcrumbs [4]. Pour the ricotta into a bowl and add the bread [5], zucchini, grated cheese [6], salt, and pepper.
Add the egg [7], then mix everything with your hands [8]. Add the flour [9]
and breadcrumbs [10], then knead everything to make a compact, uniform mixture [11]. Now form the balls, taking about 1 oz (30 g) for each one and shaping them with your hands [12]. 
Continue in this way until you’ve made about 30 balls [13]. Pour a little oil into a nonstick pan and let it warm up [14], add the meatballs and brown on both sides [15]. Set them aside while you make the sauce. 
In another frying pan, brown a clove of garlic in a little oil, add the passata [16], season with salt, and cook for about 15 minutes. Then take out the garlic clove [17] and add the zucchini balls. Add the basil [18] 
and cover with a lid [19]. Cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, turning the balls a couple of times. Meanwhile, use a coarse grater to grate the mozzarella for pizza and scatter it over the balls [20] after about 10 minutes. Cover with the lid and allow the cheese to melt. Serve your zucchini balls piping hot [21].
