A delicate aroma, excellent fragrance, and a beautiful trunk shape, with even bworning. We're talking about amor polenta, a Lombard delicacy from Varese. Here it is still prepared according to tradition in pastry shops, cafes, bakeries and delicatessen. It is precisely for this reason that amor polenta is also called "Dolce di Varese" (the Varese dessert). The special nature of amor polenta lies both in the use of the typical ridged cake pan, designed and made specifically for the preparation of this cake, and in the main ingredient: corn flour. This type of flour is usually used for the preparation of polenta, which gives the cake an inviting golden color. As Maestro Iginio Massari suggests, amor polenta should only be served sprinkled with powdered sugar. If you prefer, you can further enrich this very moist and fragrant dessert with fresh or dried fruit or chantilly cream.
