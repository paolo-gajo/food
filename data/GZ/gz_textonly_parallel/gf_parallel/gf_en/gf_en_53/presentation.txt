Who doesn't remember going to restaurants with their parents in the mid-eighties and early nineties? The most awaited moment: the dessert cart! And among very high mountains of profiteroles, tempted by tiramisu and panna cotta, in the end the winner was…Grandma’s custard pie. With its pleasant and genuine taste, custard pie is always a must! A timeless classic, it is a perfect cake after a Sunday lunch that we want you to enjoy at its best, by preparing a delicious fragrant shortcrust and divine custard. There are at least two versions of the pie: an open one, with the base and the cream directly garnished with pine nuts and powdered sugar, and a closed one, with a double layer of shortcrust pastry and custard in the middle. We have opted for the latter. We hope that your choice on the cart of Giallozafferano desserts will lead you here at least every now and then!
