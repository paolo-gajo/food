To prepare custard pie, start with the shortcrust pastry: in a mixer, place the flour and the cold butter from the fridge cut into small pieces [1], then turn on the mixer to obtain a sandy mixture: it will take a few moments. Transfer the sandy mixture to a pastry board, create a basin in the middle pour the sugar [2], and add the eggs in the middle [3].
Grate the peel of 1 lemon (preferably untreated) [4] and mix the ingredients briefly, [5] just enough time to compact the shortbread and give it the shape of a loaf, flatten slightly and cover with plastic wrap [6]. Put the shortcrust pastry in the fridge to firm up for about 30 minutes.
In the meantime, make the custard: place the milk [7] in a small saucepan, peel 1 lemon with a vegetable peeler, ensuring not to peel the bitter white part [8]; add the peel to the milk and heat it over low heat (it should almost boil) [9].
In a bowl, crack the 3 whole eggs and the yolk, pour the sugar [10], then mix the ingredients. When the sugar is absorbed, add the flour and the corn starch sifted in a sieve [12]; mix well.
In the meantime, remove the lemon peel from the milk [13] and remove the pot from the heat to slightly dilute the eggs beaten with the sugar and dry ingredients with a little hot milk [14]. Mix well, then put the pot of milk back on the stove and pour in the mixture with the eggs [15].
Continue to cook slowly and stir the cream with a whisk, as it tends to thicken (16-17), it will take about 10-15 minutes. Once ready, move it to a low, wide baking dish [18]
and cover immediately with plastic wrap [19]. Let it cool to room temperature. In the meantime, take the shortcrust pastry, lightly flour the work surface and spread it out until it forms a disc 1/10 inch (2-3 millimeters) [20] thick (you can place the shortcrust pastry between two sheets of baking paper to roll it more easily). Butter and flour a 10-inch (26 cm) diameter pan; roll the shortcrust pastry on a rolling pin and unroll it on the pan [21].
Make the bottom and edges adhere by pressing with your fingers [22]  and eliminate the excess dough which you will use to make the top shell. Poke the bottom with the prongs of a fork and pour the custard which will have cooled in the meantime [23]. Roll out the leftover shortcrust pastry and unroll the disc over the pan to cover it [24].
Using the rolling pin on the pan can help remove the excess edges (you can freeze the pastry that is left over and use it another time!) [25]; poke the surface [26] then distribute the pine nuts [27].
The custard pie is ready to be baked! Cook in a static oven preheated to 320° F (160° C) for 50 minutes on the lower shelf; after, move it to the middle shelf of the oven and cook at 355° F (180° C) for 10 minutes. If you notice that the surface darkens too much while cooking, you can cover it with aluminum foil. Bake the pie [29] and let it cool completely before sprinkling it with powdered sugar, then serve as a delicious snack or dessert at the end of your lunch [30]!
