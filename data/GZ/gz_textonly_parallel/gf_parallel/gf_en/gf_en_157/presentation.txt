The mellow heat of the evening, the softly rhythmic chattering mixed in with music and laughter, the sparkling of smiles reflected in glasses filled with a fragrant ruby red liquid... Memories of trips overlap with recollections from films, but the truth is that you can’t think about a summer evening in Spain without thinking of sangria, too. An alcoholic beverage based on full-bodied red wine, fruit, and spices, sangria can be found all over Spain, where there are also endless versions, including the white sangria typical of Catalonia. There’s a popular saying that goes, if red wine makes good blood, sangria makes it amazing! This adage is also a play on words, because the name “sangria” comes from “sangre,” the Spanish word for blood, thanks to the deep red color and passionate imagery that goes along with it. With its intense, spiced flavor and the custom to drink it ice cold, pouring fruit and beverage in equal measures into your glass with the help of a wooden spoon, sangria has earned itself a place among the essentials of any real summer party. So, what are you waiting for? Let’s make it with our recipe – and don’t forget to invite your friends!
