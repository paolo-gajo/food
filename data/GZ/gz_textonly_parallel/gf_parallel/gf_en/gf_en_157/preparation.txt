To make the sangria, first prepare the ingredients: Wash the apples and, without removing the skin, cut them first into slices [1], then into strips [2], and finally into fairly small cubes [3].
Do the same with the peaches [4]. Juice one lemon [5] and one orange [6] and set aside.
Next, cut half of the remaining oranges into slices [7], and the other half into cubes [8], without removing the peel. Do the same with the remaining lemons [9].
Now, pour the apple and peach cubes into a large bowl, and then add the juice from the citrus fruits [10] and cut up oranges and lemons [11]. Add the red wine [12] 
and sugar [13] and mix well. Move on to the spices: Cut along the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrap out the seeds [14] using the blade of a knife, then add both the bean [15] and the seeds to the bowl.
Arrange the cinnamon sticks and cloves in a tea infuser to make it easier to remove them later [16]. Place the infuser directly into the bowl or, alternatively, add the spices without using the infuser. Finally, pour in the cognac [17], stir, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap [18]. Leave to rest in the fridge for a few hours or, even better, overnight.
Once the infusion time has passed, remove the vanilla bean and spices, then add the lemon soda [19] and ice [20]. Give your sangria one last stir and itâ€™s ready for serving [21]!
