To make the cannelloni with eggplant, first prepare the fresh pasta: pour the flour into a large bowl, add the eggs [1], and mix everything [2] by hand until the resulting dough is smooth and elastic [3]. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the sauce: thinly slice the onion [4] and heat a little oil in a pan. Add the onion [5] and fry for a couple of minutes, then pour in the tomato puree [6].
Season with salt and pepper [7] and cook over low heat with the lid on for about 30 minutes [8]. After cooking, add the fragrant basil leaves [9] and set to one side.
While the sauce is cooking, you can get on with the eggplant: firstly, cut it into slices and then into cubes measuring about ½ inch (1 cm) [10]. Drizzle oil into another frying pan, add the eggplant [11] and salt [12].
Sauté over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes, then set aside to cool [13]. Now it’s time to make the béchamel sauce: melt the butter in a saucepan and heat the milk separately. When the butter has melted, pour in the flour all at once [14] and beat until the roux is golden [15].
Now add the milk slowly [16], season with salt and pepper, and continue to stir over medium heat until the sauce is thick, smooth, and even [17]. Lastly, cut the mozzarella into ½ inch (1 cm) cubes [18].
Once the dough has rested, divide it into two portions [19] for convenience and cover one of them with a tea towel to stop it from drying out. Using a pasta maker, or rolling pin if you prefer, roll out the dough until it is less than 0.05 inch (1 mm) thick [20] and cut it into 6x4 inch (15x10 cm) rectangles [21]. The sheet must be very thin, otherwise the cannelloni won't cook properly. If you prefer a thicker pasta sheet, you will need to blanch the pasta rectangles, dip them into ice water and lay them out on a clean dish towel before continuing. 
Now you are ready to assemble your cannelloni: stuff each pasta rectangle with a tablespoonful of eggplant [22] and one of mozzarella [23], then roll up to form a cylinder [24].
When you have made all the cannelloni, take a 9x9 inch (24x24 cm) baking dish, and cover the bottom with a ladle of tomato sauce and one of béchamel sauce [25]. Lay the cannelloni in the baking dish side by side [26] and top with the remaining tomato sauce [27], 
then add the rest of the béchamel sauce, blending it into the tomato with the back of a spoon [28]. Lastly, sprinkle the surface with grated Grana Padano DOP cheese [29]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (175°C) for approximately 30 minutes, then take the dish out of the oven and allow to stand for a few minutes. Serve the cannelloni with eggplant while they are piping hot [30]!
