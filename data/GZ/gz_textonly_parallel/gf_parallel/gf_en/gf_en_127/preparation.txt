To prepare the garlic, oil and chili pepper spaghetti, start by cooking the pasta in boiling salted water [1]. Cook the spaghetti al dente, and in the meantime prepare the seasoning: peel the garlic cloves, divide them in half [2] and remove the core (the green central part of each clove) [3].
Cut the cloves into rather thin slices [4]. Take the fresh chili peppers, and slice them [5] removing the center. If you prefer less spiciness, you can open them lengthwise and remove the seeds before slicing them. Now pour the oil into a large pan [6]. 
Place the pan over very low heat and add the sliced garlic [7] and chili peppers [8]. Continue to fry over very low heat; the chili and garlic should not burn, and should only fry for a couple of minutes [9].
For even browning without the risk of burning, you can tilt the pan to gather the oil, garlic and chili peppers in one area and allow them to brown evenly [10]. Once the pasta is cooked al dente, you can transfer it directly into the pan [11] and add a ladle of cooking water [12].
Stir for a few moments to combine the flavors and sauté [13], then you can plate your garlic, oil and chili pepper spaghetti (14-15) and serve very hot!
