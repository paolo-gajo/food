When we talk about quick to make first courses, what comes to mind? Cacio e pepe pasta, pasta with tuna or a flavorful pasta alla gricia! But there is an even faster dish to make when you do not have anything available in the kitchen except a few ingredients: garlic, oil and chili pepper spaghetti. It is a perfect dinner or lunch saver with only four ingredients: pasta, oil, garlic and chili peppers! The secret to success? First and foremost, the choice of ingredients, especially extra virgin olive oil. Then there is the cooking technique, which involves frying garlic and chili peppers, being very careful not to burn them and compromise the final taste. There are those who prefer dried chili peppers, those who remove the seeds to reduce the hotness, those who use the garlic whole to remove it more easily, or those who even mince it because they have no problem eating it all. How do you make it? While you are thinking about your favorite version, we invite you to taste our recipe for garlic, oil and chili pepper spaghetti!
