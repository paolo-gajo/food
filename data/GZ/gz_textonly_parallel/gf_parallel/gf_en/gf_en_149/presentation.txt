In honor of the beautiful spring days we all love, and the warm, pleasant sun they bring with them, tempting us to dine al fresco or maybe plan a little excursion, we’re delighted to share with you this delicious savory pie. Inspired by the traditional Mantovana cake, which we already did a savory recipe for, we decided to get to work and bake a delicious savory zucchini crumble. This savory pie, made with plenty of ham because it just goes so well with ricotta cheese and zucchini, is perfect for lunch outdoors or even away from home. You might want to include it on a lavish buffet table to tempt your guests, who will no doubt all be coming back for more! This delicious savory zucchini crumble is certainly a recipe that will test everyone’s self-control, including your own!
