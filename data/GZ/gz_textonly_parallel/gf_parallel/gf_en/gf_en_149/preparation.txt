To make your savory zucchini crumble, start with the crumble. Mix together the flour, baking powder [1], salt, and grated Parmigiano cheese [2] in a bowl. Next, add in the cold butter, diced [3],
and work with your fingertips [4]. When the mixture starts to compact slightly, add the egg [5], and carefully crumble the mixture into coarse crumbs [6] before setting aside in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.
Now prepare your zucchini. After cleaning and trimming them [7], cut them in half lengthwise and then into slices around ½ inch (1.5 cm) thick [8]. Moving now to the stove, pour a glug of oil into a pan and, once the bottom is hot, dip the zucchini slices into it [9].
Cook them over medium heat, stirring occasionally [10], for around 6-7 minutes or until nicely cooked, then season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl [11]. Once they have cooled completely, add the ricotta and mix [12], then set aside.
Grease a 9” (22-cm) cake pan with a removable base and a 1” (3-cm) rim [13], then line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper the same size as the mold [14]. Next, cover the base and sides of the mold with around half of the crumble [15].
Add the ricotta and zucchini, leveling out the surface [16], cover with ham [17], and top with the remaining crumble [18].
Your zucchini crumble is now ready for cooking [19]. Bake on the lowest rack of a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for around 50 minutes [20]. Once your zucchini crumble is ready, take it out of the oven and leave to cool for a few minutes before turning out and serving [21].
