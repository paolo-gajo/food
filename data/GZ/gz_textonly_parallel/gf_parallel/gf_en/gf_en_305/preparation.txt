To make the orange-roasted veal, first peel the orange [1] and slice into rounds [2]. Peel and slice the onion [3]. Next, tie the meat as shown in our practical guide to tying a roast.
Pour the butter and a drizzle of oil [4] into a fairly large pan. Add the onion and brown over very low heat [5]. Increase the flame and place the roast on top [6].
Brown the meat over high heat on both sides [7]. Transfer the meat [8] and onions [9] to a baking dish.
Lay the peeled orange slices on top [10]. Cook in a conventional oven preheated to 340째F (170째C), taking care to monitor the cooking with a probe inserted into the center of the meat, and cook until it reaches a temperature of 140째F (60째C) (this will take around 40-45 minutes). Baste the meat with the juices from time to time as it cooks [11]. Remove the meat from the oven [12].
Transfer to a sheet of aluminum foil lined with parchment paper. Wrap the meat in the parchment paper and aluminum foil [13] and leave to rest just while you prepare the gravy to serve with the roast. Transfer the cooked onions and oranges, along with the roast, to a pan and add the orange [14] juice, brandy, and white wine [15]. 
and white wine [16]. Add salt, and cook, allowing the alcohol to evaporate completely. In a separate small bowl, dilute the two teaspoons of cornstarch [17] with a teaspoon of water and mix [18].
Add this mixture to the gravy [19] and reduce as required [20]. Blend the gravy using an immersion blender [21] and keep warm in a small saucepan.
Slice an orange [22], then remove the string from around the meat [23] and carve it [24].
Pour a layer of gravy onto the bottom of a serving dish, then lay the slices of meat on top [25], followed by the sliced orange, and salt to taste with the fleur de sel [26]. Drizzle the gravy over the top and serve the orange-roasted veal piping hot [27].
