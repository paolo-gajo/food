To prepare lemon and shrimp risotto, start by heating a pot filled with water on the stove. As soon as the water comes to the boil, add a pinch of coarse salt [1]. Now add the shelled shrimps [2] and wait a couple of minutes before draining [3].
Place them on a cutting board. Coarsely chop around half of the shrimps [4] and leave the rest to one side for decorating later. Now remove the zest of half a lemon and chop it with a knife [5], or grate it. Squeeze the juice from the lemon and leave to one side [6].
Now prepare the rice. Place 1 tbsp of butter in a pan and when it starts to melt add the rice [7]. Add the rice once the butter has fully melted, so that it does not brown excessively. Stir with a wooden ladle [8] and leave the rice to toast for a few minutes. Once well toasted, add the white wine, simmer and reduce [9].
Add the lemon juice [120] and stir some more. Wait a few moments before adding a ladle of broth [11]. Continue adding broth when necessary, until the rice is fully cooked [12]. Stir occasionally, so that the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
Once cooked, add the previously coarsely chopped shrimps [13]. Add the lemon zest [14]. Stir some more, season with salt and pepper [15].
Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1.25 tbsp of butter [16]. Gently stir to cream the risotto, gently moving the pan all the while [17]. Once the risotto is nice and creamy, portion it out onto plates. Once ready to serve, garnish with the remaining shrimps and a little lemon zest. Add a pinch of black pepper, some finely chopped chives, and serve [18].
