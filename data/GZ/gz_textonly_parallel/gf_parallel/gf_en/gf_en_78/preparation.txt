To make the swordfish and eggplant bites, first wash the eggplant, place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [1] and cook for 40 minutes in a preheated conventional oven at 392°F (200°C). Meanwhile, place the swordfish and bay leaves in a pan, cover with water [2] and boil for 15 minutes. When cooked, drain the swordfish [3],
with a knife remove the skin [4] and then place it in pieces in a bowl. When the eggplant is ready, take it out of the oven, place it on a board and cut it in half lengthwise [5]. With a spoon extract the pulp [6] and place it together with the swordfish.
Blend everything [7] to reduce them to a puree, then add the eggs, grated Parmesan [8], salt [9] and pepper.
Squeeze the garlic clove [10], flavor with chopped parsley [11] and mix all the ingredients [12].
Add the breadcrumbs [13] and mix to obtain a soft dough [14]. Take small portions of dough and form balls the size of a walnut [15].
Now heat a little oil in a pan, place the balls and brown them for a minute [16], turning them, so as to obtain a homogeneous browning. In another pan heat a little oil with the chopped onion [17] and brown it for a few minutes. Then pour the tomato puree [18]
and the fish balls [19], flavored with the basil leaves and cook over low heat for 20 minutes. When cooked [20] you can enjoy your very hot swordfish and eggplant bites with tomato sauce [21].
