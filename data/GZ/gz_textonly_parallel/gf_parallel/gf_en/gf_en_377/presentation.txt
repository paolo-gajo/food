After making it soft, creamy, light and butter-free, how could we not present an invisible apple cake! No, it's not an apple dessert with superpowers, but it is a delicious version of the classic recipe: here the apples are cut into very thin slices and added to form layers in the dough, so that they melt to perfection. In this way you'll make a soft, aromatic apple cake that is still rich in fruit, perfect for breakfast or as a snack, perhaps accompanied by a creamy vanilla sauce. Even without superpowers, we're sure invisible apple cake will win you over with its simple and genuine flavor!
