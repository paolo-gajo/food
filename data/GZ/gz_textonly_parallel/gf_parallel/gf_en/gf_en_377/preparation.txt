To make invisible apple cake, start by melting the butter in a microwave or in a saucepan on a very low flame, then leave it to one side to cool [1]. Place the egg, the sugar [2] and the seeds of the vanilla bean [3] in a large bowl and stir with a manual whisk.
Add the grated lemon peel [4] and the warm melted butter [5], then stir some more to amalgamate. Sieve the flour directly into the bowl a little at a time [6] and stir it in.
Stir the sieved yeast in too [7]. Lastly, gradually add the milk [8], continue to stir to form a homogeneous mixture [9].
Leave the dough to one side and prepare the apples: wash and cut them in half, then remove the inner most part of the core with the seeds, using a corer or a knife [10]. Cut the apple halves into slices along the short side, using a mandolin [11], so that they are around 0.1 inches thick [12].
Butter and flour an 8" diameter spring mold and add 2 spoons of batter [13], then arrange a layer of apple slices on top, without overlapping them [14]. Cover with another layer of batter [15] and continue to alternate layers until you finish all the ingredients.
Complete the cake with an abundant layer of batter [16] and bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for 50 minutes. Once baked, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the mold [17]. Sprinkle with the powdered sugar and serve your invisible apple cake [18]!
