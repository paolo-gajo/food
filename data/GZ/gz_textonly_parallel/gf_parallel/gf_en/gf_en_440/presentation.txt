If you have a real penchant for tiramisu but you don't want to make it with raw or pasteurized egg, then we have just the thing for you: eggless tiramisu! Think ladyfinger biscuits dipped in coffee meet velvety mascarpone and whipped cream, the irresistible creaminess and pleasant sweetness of this typical Italian dessert making you weak at the knees with every bite. Serve in single-portion glasses for an elegant and sophisticated end to your meal, or add chocolate chips between the layers for an even richer dessert with added crunch. You might even like to try the strawberry or berry version, allowing you to enjoy the sweetness of tiramisu without quite as much guilt!
