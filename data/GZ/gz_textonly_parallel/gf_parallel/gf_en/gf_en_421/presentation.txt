Is there a creamier, more enjoyable and finger-licking dish than four-cheese gnocchi? We only have to find out by preparing this hearty first course, starting of course with the dough for the homemade potato gnocchi pasta. Do you remember all the secrets to getting the right consistency? Neither too hard nor too soft... and once ready, instead of the classic sauce or special ones we suggest elsewhere, we invite you to dip them in a velvety cream for real cheese lovers: Casera, Emmentaler, sweet Gorgonzola and Fontina cheeses. Four cheeses, also available in regional versions, with the best cheeses from your area... try for example the taleggio cheese version of speck and walnut gnocchi! Are you already dreaming of the velvety taste of these four-cheese gnocchi? A real gourmet treat to indulge in whenever you like, not just on Thursdays! Do not forget to accompany them with a good wine, in this version they will be perfect with a medium-bodied and elegantly structured Veneto red wine!
