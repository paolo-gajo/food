It is not always easy to find the right energy to wake up in the morning... but with the French toast recipe getting out of bed will be a dream! You willÂ hurry to get up to enjoy them! Although the name may suggest a French origin, French toast has American origins, where it is customary to consume it for breakfast or brunch. Slices of brioche bread, but also stale bread or toast, are soaked in a batter of milk and eggs, fried in butter and garnished with jam, honey, creams, fruit or maple syrup, just like pancakes! With its sweetness and simplicity, French toast has conquered the whole world, in fact there are different versions that change from Country to Country: from France, where we find pain perdu, to Spain, home of the torrijas, up to Hong Kong, where it is added often soy sauce too. Whatever version you choose to make, French toast is the perfect breakfast for a sweet awakening!
