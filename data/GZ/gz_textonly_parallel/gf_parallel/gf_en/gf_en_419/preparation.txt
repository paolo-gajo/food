To prepare French toast, start first of all, beat the eggs in a low and wide pan, add the milk [1], cinnamon [2] and a pinch of salt [3].
Beat everything with a fork [4]. Dip the slices of brioche bread in the egg and milk mixture [5], on both sides [6].
Meanwhile, gently melt the butter in a pan [7]. Once melted, place the slices of brioche bread [8] and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, flipping them with a spatula [9]. When they turn golden, transfer them to a plate and continue cooking the remaining slices, taking care to melt another piece of butter in the pan each time.
Once cooked, garnish your French toast directly on the serving plates: we used blueberry jam [10], a cube of butter [11] and a pinch of cinnamon. Your French toast is ready to be enjoyed [12]!
