To make the leavened brioche braid, first melt the butter and then let it cool. Next, heat the milk and pour it into a bowl where you’ve already crumbled the yeast [1]. Add the sugar [2] and mix everything until it dissolves [3].
Pour the sifted flour into the bowl of the planetary mixer, add the milk and yeast mixture [4], then the melted butter [5]. Beat both eggs and add them to the ingredients in the mixer [6]
with the zest of half a lemon [7], the seeds of one vanilla bean [8], and the salt [9]. 
Start kneading the ingredients using the dough hook to get a smooth, even mixture. The dough should turn out soft but cling to the hook nicely [10], leaving the sides of the bowl clean. Transfer it to a lightly floured work surface [11] and quickly knead it by hand [12].
Transfer the dough to a bowl [13] and cover with plastic wrap [14]. Leave to leaven at approximately 77°F (25°C) for 90 minutes [15].
After this time, transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into three equal portions weighing about 7 oz (200 g) each (16-17). Make strands that are 14 inches (35 cm) long [18] 
and braid them together. To do this, seal one end of the 3 strands [19] together and start braiding them [20]. Once the braid is finished, secure the ends well [21].
Transfer to a baking sheet covered with parchment paper [22] and leave to rise for a further 30 minutes, covered with plastic wrap [23]. When it has risen well, gently remove the plastic wrap [24].
Brush the surface with beaten egg [25] and decorate with nib sugar [26]. Bake in a conventional oven at 340°F (170°C) for approximately 35 minutes on the middle rack. The brioche braid should be soft but well-cooked and golden on the surface [27].
