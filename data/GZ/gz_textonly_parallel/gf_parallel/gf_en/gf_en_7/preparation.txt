To prepare lasagna with zucchini, start with the fresh pasta: place the flour in a bowl, make a well in the middle, add the eggs [1] and stir the flour in with a fork [2]. Once the liquid part is absorbed, start kneading by hand [3].
Place on a pastry board and knead for around 10 minutes [4]. Wrap it in plastic wrap once smooth [5] and leave to rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes [6].
In the meantime prepare the bechamel: start by heating the milk and delicately melting the butter [7]. Add the flour all in one go [8] and stir with a whisk [9].
Pour in the hot milk after 1-2 minutes [10], stirring all the while to prevent lumps from forming. Continue stirring for around 5 minutes until the sauce takes on the right consistency [11]. Once cooked, flavor with salt and nutmeg and cover with plastic wrap so as to avoid a skin from forming [12].
Now prepare the zucchini: leave 0.8 cups to one side for later, tip [13] and thinly slice the remaining ones with a mandolin [14]. Now tip the zucchini you left to one side and coarsely chop them up [15].
Place them in the bowl of a mixer [16] and add the previously washed basil, some salt [17]and the oil [18].
Blend the ingredients into a smooth and homogeneous cream with an immersion blender [19]. Leave to one side [20]. Now take the piece of pasta dough and divide it in half; keep the half you are not using covered in the plastic wrap [21].
Briefly knead the piece of dough with a pinch of flour and then feed it through the rolls of a pasta machine [22]: start on the thickest setting and gradually work your way down to the thinnest one [23]. Cut the resulting pasta sheets into rectangles that are roughly 3.5"x6.2" in size [24].
Place your pasta sheets on a tray lined with a lightly dampened cloth [25]. Now you can compose the lasagna: take a 8"x12" baking tray and add a layer of bechamel on the bottom [26]. Add the first layer of pasta sheets [27].
Spread some more bechamel over it [28] and add the zucchini pieces so that they are facing in the opposite direction from the pasta [29]. Add salt, pepper and a sprinkling of grated cheese [30].
Now add a few spoons of zucchini cream [31] and proceed with another layer of pasta, bechamel [32], salt, pepper and cheese and lastly, the zucchini cream [33]. Continue until you finish all the ingredients.
Pour any remaining bechamel and zucchini cream over the last layer of zucchini, sprinkle with cheese [34]: it is ready to be baked. Bake lasagna with zucchini in a static oven preheated to 392F for around 40 minutes + 4-5 minutes under the grill for a nice and golden surface [35]. Leave to rest for 5 minutes after baking, then sprinkle the basil over it and serve [36].
