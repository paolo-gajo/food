To make the yogurt and berries popsicles, pour the organic lemon yogurt into a bowl, add the sugar [1], the lemon juice [2] and the milk [3].
Stir with a whisk to mix the mixture [4] then distribute half the mixture in a jug and half in a bowl to which you will add the fresh berries [5]. Blend the yogurt and fruit mixture [6]
until you get a homogeneous cream [7]. Transfer it to a jug [8], this way it will be easier to pour it into the popsicle molds [9]. Fill half of each mold. Place them in the freezer to harden this first part for about 40 minutes.
Once they have solidified, take the ice creams out of the freezer, and fill with the remaining amount of yogurt [10]. At this point cover with the lid [11] and insert the sticks in each holes [12]. Place in the freezer and let your popsicles solidify for at least 3 hours.
After this time the popsicles will be ready, remove the lid [13], to easily extract the popsicles pass the mold under cold water for a few moments [14], then take them out and enjoy them immediately [15]!
