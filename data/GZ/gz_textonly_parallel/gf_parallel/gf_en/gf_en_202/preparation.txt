To prepare pumpkin bites, start with the pumpkin (we used the violin variety, but other types will work great too, like the delica): divide it in half [1] and remove the skin, then cut into slices that are half a centimeter thick each [2], to obtain 500 g of pumpkin pulp. Arrange the pumpkin slices onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, drizzle with oil [3] and sprinkle with salt before baking in a static oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, finely chop the sage leaves [4] and finely dice the smoked scamorza cheese [5]. When the pumpkin is ready [6], remove from the oven and place in a bowl.
Mash the pumpkin with a fork [7], then add the breadcrumbs [8], the grated Parmigiano cheese [9],
the egg [10] and the finely chopped sage [11]. Mix the ingredients thoroughly by hand and add pepper to taste [12].
Roll the mixture into balls, around 1.4 oz each, and place a few dices of smoked scamorza cheese in the middle of each one [13]. Close the balls to encase the cheese and roll by hand to make them rounder in shape [14]. Repeat with all the other balls: you should make around 16 with these amounts. Now heat the frying oil to 340°F (170°C) (preferably measured using a cooking thermometer), coat each ball in the breadcrumbs [15]
and fry in the oil for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese inside [16]. Remember to fry only a few balls at a time so that the temperature of the oil does not drop too much. When they are nice and golden, leave them to drain on a piece of absorbent kitchen paper, to eliminate excess oil [17]. You pumpkin bites are ready to be served, while hot and stringy [18]!
