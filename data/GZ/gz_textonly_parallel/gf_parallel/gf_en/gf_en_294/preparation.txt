To prepare the paccheri pasta with calamari, place a pan with plenty of water to cook the pasta on the stove. Once it’s boiling, add salt to taste. Then start cleaning the calamari. Cut the tentacles away from the rest of the squid and make rings approximately ½ inch (1.5 cm) thick [1]. Then cut the cherry tomatoes in half and set aside [2]. Lastly, slice the chili pepper thinly and remove the stalk [3].
Crush the garlic cloves (you can also use whole peeled cloves and remove them after cooking) in a pan with a little oil [4] and let them sweat with the chili pepper [5] for a few minutes over low heat. Add the squid rings with the tentacles and cook over high heat for just 1 minute [6], so that the squid does not become too tough.
Pour in the white wine [7] and allow it to simmer for a few minutes so that it evaporates. Add the cherry tomatoes [8] and the tomato puree [9].
Mix [10] and let everything cook over low heat for 5-6 minutes. In the meantime, pour the paccheri pasta into salted boiling water [11] and then drain halfway through cooking (reserving some of the cooking water) and pour straight into the pan with the sauce [12].
You will need a few ladlefuls of the reserved pasta cooking water to finish cooking the pasta [13]; pour in a little at a time as needed and stir frequently. In the meantime, finely chop the parsley [14] and sprinkle it over the paccheri [15] once cooked. Everything is ready, your paccheri pasta with calamari can be eaten piping hot!
