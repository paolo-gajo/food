To make stracchino della duchessa, start with the preparation of pate à bombe: in a planetary mixer fitted with a whisk, place the eggs and 3 tbsp (40 g) of sugar [1], whip the ingredients until the mixture is light and fluffy. Meanwhile, pour the water into a saucepan [2] and add the remaining sugar [3].
place over the heat and bring to 250°F (121°C) [4] (monitor the temperature with a food thermometer). When the syrup has reached the indicated temperature, pour it slowly into the planetary mixer where you whipped the eggs with sugar [5]. Continue whisking until completely cooled. Meanwhile, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl [6],
add a spoonful of pate à bombe [7] and mix. Then incorporate the rest of the pate à bombe, mixing from the bottom up. Divide the mixture in two bowls [8]: add cocoa powder to one half [9]
and almond flakes [10]. Add chocolate chips to the other half [11]. Grease and line a 11"x4" (28 x 11 cm) loaf pan [12] with parchment paper.
Let's move to the ladyfingers: prepare the coffee with a mocha (about 6 cups), pour it in a large baking dish, add sugar to taste [13]. Add 1 tbsp of rum [14] while the coffee is still hot and let it cool. Dip the ladyfingers one at a time [15]
and place them on the bottom and on the edges of the loaf pan [16]. Take the two bowls with pate à bombe and transfer them in two disposable pastry bags. Cut at the tip out and create a first layer with the darker pate à bombe [17] and then with the lighter one [18]
taking care to leave about .4" (1 cm) from the edge [19]. Cover the surface of stracchino with other ladyfingers soaked in the coffee sauce [20]. Place stracchino della duchessa in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours: the cake must be very cold, turn it upside down on a serving plate and remove the mold [21]
Sprinkle your stracchino della duchessa with dark cocoa powder [22] and almonds flakes [23]. And this delicious dessert is ready to be brought to the table [24].
