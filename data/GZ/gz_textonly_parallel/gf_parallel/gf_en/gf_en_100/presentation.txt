Stracchino della duchessa is a refined semifreddo dessert, made with a pate à bombe, or a cream with semi-pasteurized eggs, whipped with hot sugar syrup. Flavored with chocolate chips, cocoa and almonds, this delicious dessert is prepared in a loaf pan covered with ladyfingers dipped in coffee and liqueur. It is because of this particular elongated shape that we call it stracchino, similar to the one of the stracchino cheese. The origin of the stracchino della duchessa is uncertain, broadly speaking it comes from the provinces of Parma, Modena and Mantua, where it is said that a noblewoman invented this refined recipe.
