To make lemon chicken, start by grating the peel [1], squeezing [2] and filtering [3] the juice of a lemon.
Now clean the chicken breast: cut the breast in half [4], remove the fattier parts and cut into strips [5], then into smaller pieces [6].
Now place the chicken in the flour [7] and stir until thoroughly coated [8]. Heat the olive oil in a pan [9];
when nice and hot, add the chicken pieces [10] and brown on a medium flame for around 5 minutes; turn them over occasionally [11] until nice and brown. Remove from the heat and leave to one side.?Prepare the sauce: place the starch and water in a bowl [12].
Now add the sugar [13], the soy sauce [14] and the lemon juice [15].
Add the resulting liquid to the same pan you browned the chicken in [16], leave to thicken for 1 minute, beat with a whisk [17] and add the chicken [18].
Stir slowly and cook for 3-4 minutes. Once cooked, flavor with the lemon peel (19 ) and fresh oregano [20]. Serve the lemon chicken nice and hot [21].
