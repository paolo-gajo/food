To make the baked gnocchi parmigiana, start with the gnocchi: boil the potatoes starting from cold water for about 30-40 minutes starting from the boil [1]; when you can easily pierce them with a fork you can drain them. Switch to the sauce, frying the garlic in the oil in a saucepan for a few minutes. Pour the tomato puree [2], salt and add the basil leaves [3].
Cover with a lid and cook over low heat for at least 60 minutes [4]; after this time, remove the garlic from the pan. While the sauce and the potatoes are cooking, take care of the aubergines: wash them and cut them into cubes of about .8-1" (2-3 cm) [5], then flour them with the rice flour [6].
Bring the seed oil to a temperature of 340°F (170°C). Sift the eggplant to remove excess flour and fry them a little at a time [7]. When they are golden brown, drain the eggplant [8] and transfer them to absorbent kitchen paper [9]. Keep aside.
Arrange the flour on a pastry board and mash the still hot potatoes on top [10]; the peel will remain inside the potato masher. Add the lightly beaten egg with a pinch of salt [11], then mix everything with your hands [12]. Do not knead the dough too much, otherwise your gnocchi will be hard.
When you have obtained a soft and homogeneous dough [13] take one portion at a time and roll it out with your fingertips to obtain .8" (2 cm) thick loaves [14]; in the meantime, cover the remaining dough with a cloth to prevent it from drying out. Cut the loaves into chunks [15].
Drag the chunks onto the tines of a fork to obtain the classic grooves [16]; help yourself by sprinkling the top with semolina to prevent them from sticking. As they are ready, arrange the gnocchi on a lightly floured cloth with semolina, spacing them apart [17]. At this point, put a saucepan with plenty of water on the stove and in the meantime cut the provolone into cubes [18].
When the water boils, add salt and add a few gnocchi at a time [19]. As soon as they come to the surface, you can drain the gnocchi and transfer them directly to the tomato sauce [20]. Mix well to mix the gnocchi with the sauce [21].
Also add the fried eggplant and mix again [22]. Take a 10"x10" (24x24 cm) baking dish and pour half of the gnocchi so seasoned inside, then add half of the diced provolone [23] and sprinkle with half of the grated Grana cheese [24].
Repeat the layers adding the remaining half of the gnocchi [25], the provolone and the grated cheese [26]. Turn on the grill of the oven at 465°F (240°C) and bake for 4-5 minutes, then add a few basil leaves [27]. Your baked gnocchi parmigiana are ready to be served!
