To make these tiramisu truffles, first prepare the coffee (you will need a total of 1/3 cup (80 g) and leave to cool to room temperature. Place the ladyfingers in a food processor [1] and blitz until reduced to a powder. In the meantime, transfer the mascarpone to a bowl [2], and add the room-temperature coffee [3], 
along with the powdered sugar [4]. Mix everything together using a spatula [5] to achieve an even consistency. Next, add the powdered ladyfingers [6], 
and stir again to combine [7]. Once the dough is thoroughly combined, take around a teaspoon of dough [8] and shape it into a ball [9]. You’ll get around 30 of these at ½ oz (15 g) each. 
Next, roll each ball in the cocoa [10], and place them one by one on a tray lined with parchment paper [11]. If you want to serve them immediately, leave them in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm up; otherwise, put them in the refrigerator. Place your tiramisu truffles [12] in small cupcake liners before serving.
