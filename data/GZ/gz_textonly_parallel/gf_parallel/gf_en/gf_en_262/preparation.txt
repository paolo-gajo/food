To prepare the pasta with creamy pumpkin sauce, first cut the pumpkin into large pieces [1], remove the seeds and inner strands [2], then cut into slices and remove the skin [3].
Cut the slices into strips and then into cubes measuring about Â½ inch (1 cm) [4]. Then cut the pancetta into small strips [5]. Set the pumpkin and pancetta aside in two bowls [5].
Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Chop the shallot [6] and add to some oil [7] heated in a frying pan. Stir and allow to cook gently [8], stirring occasionally to keep it from burning.
When the shallot has softened, add the pancetta [9] and fry for a few minutes together with the rosemary sprigs. Leave the rosemary sprig whole and remove it once the oil has absorbed its flavor. Then add the pumpkin to the pan [10] and mix everything together [11].
Season with salt and pepper [12], cover with vegetable broth (or hot water), and cook for 15-20 minutes [13]. When the water in the pot is boiling, add the pasta to cook [15].
Remove a portion of the pumpkin, being careful not to take the pancetta as well [16], and transfer it to a food processor [17] together with the ricotta [18].
Blend to obtain a creamy mixture [19], then transfer back to the pan with the sauce [20] to give it the right creamy texture [21].
When the pasta is al dente, drain it and pour directly into the pan [22]. Stir the pasta well to absorb the sauce [23]. Now the pasta with creamy pumpkin sauce is ready to serve [24]. Enjoy!
