To make chocolate chip muffins, leave the butter out of the fridge for at least 1 hour to soften. Combine the softened butter with sugar [1], and beat with an electric mixer until you achieve a fluffy and creamy mixture [2]. Then, split a vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds using the back of a knife [3].
Pour these into the bowl with the butter and sugar [4]. Start the mixer again and add the eggs, also at room temperature, one at a time [5], to prevent the ingredients from separating [6].
Now sift the flour [7], the baking powder [8], and the baking soda [9] directly into the bowl with the mixture.
Also add a pinch of salt and activate the mixer again to incorporate the dry ingredients [10]. You'll notice the batter becomes thicker, so thin it out with room temperature milk added gradually [11]. At this point, the mixture will be soft and compact [12].
Combine 80 g (about 3 oz) of chocolate chips [13] and gently mix them in using a spatula. Then, transfer the batter into a disposable piping bag without a tip [14] for a cleaner process, or you can simply use a spoon if preferred. Place paper liners in a muffin tray and fill each one about 2/3 full, leaving just under a centimeter from the top [15]. Each muffin should weigh approximately 70 g (about 2.5 oz).
On the muffins, sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips [16], and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for 18-20 minutes in static mode [17]. At this point, your chocolate chip muffins are ready to be enjoyed [18].
