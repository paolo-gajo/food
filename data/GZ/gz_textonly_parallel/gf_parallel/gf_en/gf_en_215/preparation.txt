To make the potato crumble, first cook the potatoes with their skins on. Starting with the water cold [1], boil them for 30-40 minutes from the time they start to boil or until they are soft when tested with a fork. Slice the smoked Mozzarella di bufala cheese [2], lay out the slices on a tray lined with paper towels, and then cover with another sheet of paper and press down gently to squeeze them dry [3]. Let the slices rest like this for 20 minutes to ensure the mozzarella dries out properly.
Once the potatoes are cooked, mash them with a potato masher [4] and collect the resulting purée in a large bowl. Allow to cool, add the cornstarch [5] and half of the Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese [6], 
the salt [7], and the whole egg [8], then mix everything with your hands [9] 
to obtain a smooth mixture [10]. Line an 8-inch (20 cm) diameter cake pan [11] and add about four heaped tablespoons of the mixture [12] to create an even base.
Press the dough down with your fingers to form a compact layer [13]. Using your hands, sprinkle the coarsely chopped mozzarella slices [14] and the rolled pancetta [15] over the base, 
then cover everything with the remainder of the mixture. Make sure it is properly stuck down to create a lid and then crumble the topmost layer with your fingers [16]. Add a drizzle of oil [17] and season with pepper [18].
Top with the rest of the Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese (19-20) and cook in an oven preheated to 350°F (180°C), on the middle shelf, for 25 minutes. After the 25 minutes is up, turn on the grill and broil for another 8 minutes. When cooked, the surface of the savory crumble will be golden brown. You can now take it out of the oven, let it cool [21], and serve it sliced.
