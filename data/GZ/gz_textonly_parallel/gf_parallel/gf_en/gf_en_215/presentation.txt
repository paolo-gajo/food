One of our favorite culinary pastimes is creating savory dishes using traditional dessert methods. We have transformed sweet treats such as muffins, pancakes, profiteroles, and cookies into tasty morsels to be enjoyed as appetizers with delectable and imaginative fillings that deliver every time! We came up with two tasty savory versions of torta sbrisolona (crumble cake), a Mantuan delicacy: one with ham and provola cheese and the other with ricotta and zucchini. Spurred on by the success of those recipes, we decided to try out a new flavorsome dough with a softer texture: potato crumble. This dish is served in slices, each harboring a delicious filling you can savor bite by bite!
