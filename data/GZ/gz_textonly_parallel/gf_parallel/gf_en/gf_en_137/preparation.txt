To prepare your Sicilian-style mini penne, begin by washing the eggplant, removing the two ends and cutting it first into slices [1] and then into sticks ½ inch (1 cm) thick that you’ll then dice [2]. Place the diced eggplants in a colander, and place this over a container. Sprinkle with coarse salt [3], 
and place a plate over it with a weight on top [4]. Leave it like this for at least an hour so that the salt flushes out the bitter vegetable water from the eggplant [5]. After this time, rinse the cubes briefly under running water [6] to remove any excess salt 
and dry them with a clean cloth [7]. Fry in plenty of boiling oil, adding a few cubes at a time [8] to avoid lowering the temperature of the oil too much, as it should remain at 340-350°F (170-180°C). Once the eggplant has cooked for a few minutes, drain it on paper towel [9].
Cut the mozzarella into thin slices of around ¼ inch (½ cm) thick and then into strips of the same size [10]. Finally, chop it into very small cubes and place in a colander positioned over a container [11]. Leave it like this for at least an hour, so that all the liquid drains from the fior di latte [12].
In the meantime, prepare the tomato sauce. Peel and chop the onion [13], slice the chili pepper, remove the stem [14], and cut into thin strips. You might also want to remove the seeds if you want to tone down the spice! Next, pour some oil into a pan, add the chopped onion and chili and fry for a few minutes, stirring continuously to make sure they don’t burn [15].
Once the onion has softened, add the peeled chopped tomatoes [16] and cook for at least half an hour over low heat, seasoning with salt to taste. When the sauce is ready, add the fried eggplant [17], allowing the flavor to infuse into the sauce [18] for a few minutes before turning off the heat.
Cook the pasta in boiling salted water [19], taking care to drain it a couple of minutes before it’s cooked, and pour it into the sauce with the eggplant [20]. Tear up the basil leaves with your hands and add them [21]
together with the diced fior di latte, setting some aside for the garnish [22]. Mix everything together, still with the heat off [23]. Fill four 1¼-cup (300-ml) bowls with the mixture [24]
and garnish with a few pieces of the remaining fior di latte on the top [25]. Place your bowls on a baking sheet and broil them in an oven preheated to 460°F (240°C) for 2-3 minutes until a crust has formed on the surface [26]. At this point, your Sicilian-style mini penne will be ready [27]. Serve piping hot, and enjoy!
