To prepare the fruit tart, start with the shortcrust pastry: put flour, the icing sugar [1], the seeds scraped from a vanilla bean [2] and the cold butter into small pieces [3] in a bowl.
Work the ingredients with your hands until you get a sandy mixture [4], then add the egg yolks [5] and knead again [6].
When you have obtained a homogeneous and soft dough [7] wrap it in cling film and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes [8]. If you can't work it well in a bowl, move to a work surface to compact it quickly, until it is homogeneous. Meanwhile, prepare the custard by pouring the milk into a saucepan [9]
Perfume by grating the lemon zest [10], turn on the heat over low heat and bring it to just touch the boil. Pour the egg yolks into another larger saucepan, add the sugar [11] and mix. Also add the cornstarch and flour [12].
Mix avoiding the formation of lumps [13]. At this point the milk should be ready, pour a little to dilute the mixture [14], mix, add the remaining milk and mix again. Move everything to the stove and cook the cream, stirring constantly, until it becomes firm. This will take approximately 10 minutes [15].
Transfer the cream into a low and wide container, cover it with contact film and let it cool to room temperature; then put it in the refrigerator to harden [16]. Retrieve the shortcrust pastry, roll it out on a lightly floured pastry board and make a 4 mm thick circle [17], lift the disc with a rolling pin and unroll into the 24 cm mold. Pass the rolling pin on the surface to remove the excess [18].
Prick the bottom with the tines of a fork [19] and switch to cooking in white: it means cooking the base of the tart without filling, in a static oven, already hot at 350°F (180°C), for about 20/25 minutes [20]. Remove the pastry base from the oven and let it cool [21].
Work the cooled cream with a whisk [22], transfer it to a pastry bag and stuff the pastry shell [23]. Level the surface with the back of a spoon and place the tart in the refrigerator [24].
In the meantime, move on to cleaning and cutting the fruit. Start with the pineapple, peel it [25] and cut it into half cm thick slices. Then derive from each obtaining 8 triangles [26]. Switch to the kiwifruit, peel it, divide it in half lengthwise and cut it into slices [27].
Finally, take care of the strawberries. Remove the stalk and make 4 wedges from each [28]. Switch to the decoration: do not too orderly. Then on the base decorated first with the strawberry wedges with the tip facing upwards [29], then add the slices of kiwi [30].
Continue with the pineapple inserting the triangles until almost the entire surface is covered [31]. Complete garnishing with berries and a few mint leaves here and there [32]. Your fruit tart is ready [33].
