Strawberries, the summer fruit par excellence, so juicy and fresh! How about using this delicacy to make a dessert? In the recipe of the strawberry cake, however, they will be used not only fresh in the filling or as a garnish, but also blended with the other ingredients of the mixture. You will obtain a soft cake with a delicate taste and pinkish color, which you can enrich with whipped cream and slices of fresh strawberries! A real treat to serve as dessert at the end of a meal or as a tasty snack, but also a perfect birthday cake, like its "cousin" mascarpone cheese and strawberry cake. Did you like the idea of adding blended fruit to the cake mix? Try also the peach loaf and discover a sweeter summer!
