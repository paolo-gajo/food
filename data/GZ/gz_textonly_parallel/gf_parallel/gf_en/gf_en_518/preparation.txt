To prepare the carrot fries, start with the breading. Then chop the rosemary [1] and pour it into a bowl together with the grated cheese (2-3).
Peel the thyme [4], add the paprika [5] and mix everything well [6].
Now let's take care of the carrots. After having peeled them [7], trim them and cut them in half or in four parts, depending on the size [8]. Finally cut into sticks of about 1/2 inch (1 cm) [9].
If you prefer to proceed with the simpler breading without eggs, you can dip the carrots into the breading and make it adhere well by massaging the carrot sticks in the bowl [10]. Fry the breaded carrots in boiling oil at 350°F (180°C) (measure the the oil temperature with a kitchen thermometer) [11]. As soon as they turn golden brown drain them and place them on absorbent paper [12].
Garnish with the breading left over [13], a pinch of salt [14] and continue cooking the rest of the sticks. Serve your carrot fires with cranberry jam and enjoy [15].
