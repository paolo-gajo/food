Surely it will have happened to you at least once that you have raised the carrots by the tuft and thought: "what do I prepare today with these?" Today we prepare carrot fries! We present them to you in two ways: with a light and spicy breading without eggs or with the addition of egg yolk and flour for a super crunch effect! Whatever you decide to do, the result will be delicious! Golden, yellow and even purple, carrots lend themselves to the most varied preparations: velvety, sweet and sour side dishes, delicious cakes and even to prepare a spectacular and colorful cake! But to all these proposals we could not but add an even more delicious version, which will really appeal to everyone. Even french fries lovers will not miss or say no to these delicious carrot fries.
