To make summer zucchini cordon bleu, start by cutting the tip [1] and the bottom of the zucchini [2]. Now slice into 0.2 inch (0.5 cm) slices using a mandoline slicer [3].
Slice the provola cheese too [4]. Now top a slice of squash with the provola cheese [5] and the prosciutto cotto [6].
Now close with another slice of zucchini, just like a sandwich [7]. Prepare the bread coating: beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper [8]. Place the flour in another bowl and add the salt [9]. Lastly, prepare a third bowl with breadcrumbs.
Now dip the stuffed zucchini in the flour [10], then in the beaten eggs [11] and lastly, in the breadcrumbs [12].
Add a second layer coating by dipping the cordon bleu first in the egg [13] and then in the breadcrumbs [14]. As you coat the zucchini pieces, place them on a tray [15].
Now fry them: heat the seed oil in a deep pan to 330°F (165°C) (measure with a cooking thermometer) and add the cordon bleu pieces one at a time [16]. Fry for around 2 minutes until golden. Drain on a tray lined with absorbent kitchen paper [17]. Serve the zucchini cordon bleu nice and hot [18].
