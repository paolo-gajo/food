A melted and appetizing filling encased in two layers of meat: this is the traditional recipe for cordon bleu. We have enjoyed revisiting it in other tempting ways: from polenta cordon bleu to an eggplant version, all equally delicious. The success of this irresistible preparation inspired us to create another version: zucchini cordon bleu. To make these stuffed medallions, select some round zucchini that can be cut into slices that are perfect for encasing the filling, much like a sandwich. Right from the first bite you will discover one of the most popular fillings ever, featuring the timeless pairing of prosciutto cotto and provola cheese, although you can give your culinary imagination free rein and try combining new and tempting ingredients!
