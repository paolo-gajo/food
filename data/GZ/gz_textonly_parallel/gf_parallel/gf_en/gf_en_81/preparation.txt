To make the sweet and sour baby onions, pour the raw sugar [1] and water [2] into a pot. Melt the sugar over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, then add the butter [3].
Wash [4] the onions and season with salt [5] and pepper. Once the butter has melted, add them to the pot. Cook for a couple of minutes over medium heat, stirring often to cover them evenly in the glaze [6].
Now add the vinegar [7]. Let the strong smell of the vinegar evaporate without letting the liquid dry up [8], then add the thyme [9].
Cover the pot with a lid and cook over medium-low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally [10]; if it goes dry or starts to take on too much color, you can add a little water. After this cooking time is up, check whether the onions are tender [11]; if youâ€™d like a more buttery consistency, you can cook them for another 10 minutes. To make the glaze thicker, you can add a knob of cold butter at the end of the cooking time. Your sweet and sour baby onions are ready to go [12]!
