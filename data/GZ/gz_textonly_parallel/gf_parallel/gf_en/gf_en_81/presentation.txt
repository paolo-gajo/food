A side dish that’s simple but that makes a big impact and is capable of bringing out the taste of the dish it’s accompanying: sweet and sour baby onions! A great classic of Italian culinary tradition, ideal for serving warm or at room temperature, perhaps as an appetizer along with some mature or semi-mature cheeses. The pungent note from the vinegar is softened by the sweetness of the sugar, while the addition of butter makes the glaze particularly silky smooth. The result is a dish with a deliciously balanced flavor, which will become even better if you try it the following day. Think onions aren’t “romantic” enough to have earned a place on the table? Well, the celebrated Chilean poet Pablo Neruda even wrote an ode to this vegetable, where he defines it as “destined to shine”... even in your dishes!
