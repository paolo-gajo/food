To prepare the aquacotta, first prepare the vegetable broth and keep it warm. Start by peeling the onions [1], then cut them in half [2] and slice them thinly [3]. 
Transfer them to a bowl and move to the celery. First wash it well, then cut the stalks [4] and leaves [5] into fairly thin slices. Pour the oil into a pan [6],
put over heat and add the onions and celery [7]. Add water [8] and salt [9]. 
Mix with a wooden ladle [10] and cook until the water has completely evaporated. Then add the peeled tomatoes [11] and crush them gently with the ladle [12].
Mix everything [13], add the hot vegetable broth [14], stir again and cook for about 40 minutes, possibly covering with a lid [15] and stirring occasionally. 
When the oil has surfaced, add some basil leaves and the eggs by breaking them directly into the pan [16]. Arrange them distanced from each other. Add salt [17] and cover with a lid [18]. 
Leave the eggs to cook for about 4-5 minutes [19]. Meanwhile, crumble a thin slice of stale Tuscan bread in each cocotte bowl. You can crumble it with your hands and arrange it to line the bottom [20]. Add grated pecorino cheese on top [21]
and add the soup with the ladle, making sure to take one egg for each cocotte [22]. Garnish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a basil leaf [23] and serve [24].
