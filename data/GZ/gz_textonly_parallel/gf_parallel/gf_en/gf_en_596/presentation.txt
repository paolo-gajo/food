A dish is not just a list of ingredients, how to prepare them and cooking times. Sometimes a dish is a tale, a story, a memory. And it becomes a recipe that restores, warms hearts, and refreshes souls. This is the case of acquacotta, the ancient soup of Tuscan tradition that speaks of farmers, charcoal burners, shepherds and woodcutters of the Maremma at a time when hunger made people more creative, and soups were the only meal that could be afforded after one's hard work. It was a lucky dish that contained what was available in the season: tomatoes, celery, onions, wild herbs, local cheese for flavor and a nice egg to give substance, added to the soup as soon as it was made to cook in the hot broth... it is a simple soup, but at the same time rich in nutrients, such as farmer's soup or Pavia soup, typical of another region of Italy. A few slices of stale toasted bread complete the dish and make it even richer. Acquacotta, cooked for Giallozafferano by Valeria Piccini, is simply a good, genuine, and tasty dish that keeps the rustic and sincere flavors of the past alive.
