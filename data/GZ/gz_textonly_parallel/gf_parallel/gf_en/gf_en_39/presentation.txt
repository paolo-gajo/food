There are a lot of recipes that are part of personal easy dinner cookbooks! They start from the classic spaghetti with garlic, oil and chili peppers up to frittatas orÂ  farmer's eggs, so as to have both the first and second courses in less than forty minutes. Even a meat dish can be quick and tasty at the same time, like scaloppini: quick and succulent slices of meat to be topped as you would like. In this recipe we offer white wine and parsley scalloppini, a Milanese dish. The wine, with a vaguely acidic touch, improves the taste of the meat and also allows you to obtain a delicious and creamy sauce. Parsley, on the other hand, in Milanese dialect "erborin", is an ideal ingredient because it will render the meat fresh and delicious. We bet you will be really surprised by this easy and fast main course! If you still have a few minutes to dedicate to cooking, add some quick and very fresh cheesecake to your menu!
