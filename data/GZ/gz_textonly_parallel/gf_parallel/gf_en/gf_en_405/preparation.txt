To prepare the fruit tartlets, you’ll first need to make your pie dough. If you like, you can work the ingredients by hand in the order that we suggest; otherwise, do so in a planetary mixer bowl using the flat beater. Pour in the flour, baking powder [1], and cold butter cut into small pieces[2]. Mix for a few minutes until the mixture becomes sandy in texture, then add the sugar [3]
and salt [4]. Turn on the mixer again and mix until everything is well crumbled. Flavor with the zest of half a lemon [5] and add the eggs [6].  
Knead until the mixture is firm [7]. Transfer the dough to a flat surface and knead lightly with your hands to form a loaf [8]. Then, cover with plastic wrap and leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour [9]. 
Once it has rested, take the dough and use a rolling pin to roll it out on a floured surface [10] to a thickness of ¼ inch (0.5 cm). Next, cut discs out [11] of the dough using a pastry cutter with a 3-inch (8 cm) diameter. Use these to line 22 scalloped molds with a 2¾-inch (7 cm) diameter, ensuring that the dough adheres well to the sides of the molds [12] and removing any excess dough. 
Prick the bases with the prongs of a fork [13] to prevent them from rising as they cook. Bake the cases in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for around 18-20 minutes [14]. Once golden brown, remove from the oven and leave to cool before turning out onto a tray [15]. 
While the cases are cooling completely, prepare the pastry cream. Heat the milk together with the vanilla bean [16] and the seeds extracted from it. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with the sugar [17] in a small bowl before adding the cornstarch [18].
Stir gently with a beater to combine [10]. Now that the milk is hot, remove the bean [20] and trickle a little on the mixture to dilute it, before mixing thoroughly with a beater [21]. 
Transfer this mixture to the small saucepan containing the milk [22] and stir continuously on low heat [23] until the cream has thickened. The pastry cream is now ready. Transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave to cool [24]. 
Transfer the pastry cream to a pastry bag with a star-shaped nozzle [25] and fill the dough cases, garnishing with your choice of fruits. We chose strawberries, kiwi, and berries, with a few mint leaves to fragrance [26]. Finally, dilute the jelly with hot water or place it in a small saucepan [27] and heat for a few seconds, 
just enough to melt it [28]. Glaze the fruit using a small brush [29], and your fruit tartlets are ready to serve [30]!
