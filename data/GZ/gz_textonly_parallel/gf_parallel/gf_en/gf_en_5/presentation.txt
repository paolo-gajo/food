Zucchini pesto is a delicious and fragrant condiment. It is ideal for enriching toast and starters, not to mention a perfect pasta sauce. This version is very different from your usual traditional pesto and never fails to intrigue: unlike Genoese pesto, its added value lies in its note of freshness, thanks to the raw zucchini! Served with Shrimps, salmon,Â goat cheese or dried tomatoes, zucchini pesto turns every first course into a unique and creamy dish. With summer just around the corner, you won't be able to do without it... this delicate cream will win you over with its flavor: it is quick to prepare and you won't even have to switch the stove on.
