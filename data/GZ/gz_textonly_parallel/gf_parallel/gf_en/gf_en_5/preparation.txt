To prepare zucchini pesto, wash and tip the zucchini [1], then use a grater with large holes to grate them [2]. Place the grated zucchini in a colander [3], add a little salt and leave them to rest for 30 minutes, to drain the excess liquid.
Now place them in a mixer [4] together with the pine nuts [5] and basil leaves, previously cleaned using a dry cloth [6].
Add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [7], the Pecorino cheese [8] and a part of the oil [9]. Now turn the mixer on and blend for a few seconds.
Add the remaining part of the oil [10] and blend to obtain a homogeneous cream [11]. Place the mixture in a bowl [12] and use the zucchini pesto as required.
