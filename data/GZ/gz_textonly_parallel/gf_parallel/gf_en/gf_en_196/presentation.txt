It wouldn’t be fall or winter without the aroma of cooked pumpkin wafting through Mantua, as it’s the main ingredient in the city’s standout dish, pumpkin tortelli. The recipe for this dish has been codified since the Renaissance age and strongly bears the mark of the tastes of the time: sweet and sour and rich, with sumptuous and charmingly old-fashioned ingredients such as amaretti cookies and Mantuan mustard, which give the typical sweet flavor to the filling encased in an egg pasta parcel. Chef Alessandra Viola has been carrying on the generations-old tradition in her family’s historic restaurant and will show us how to make this dish that’s a symbol of her region. Today, pumpkin tortelli are typically eaten on Christmas Eve, but we’re sure that once you taste them, you’ll want to repeat the experience whenever the weather is colder, maybe, for example, at Halloween when pumpkins are plentiful. This is an unforgettable dish to share with friends and family that will make you feel like you’re at the court of the Duke of Mantua!
