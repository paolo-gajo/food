To make the pumpkin tortelli, start by preparing the filling: Clean the pumpkin and cut it into slices around 1 1/4 inch (3 cm) thick [1], then remove the skin and chop the flesh into even-sized pieces so they will cook evenly [2]. Arrange the pieces of pumpkin on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper [3] and cook in a conventional oven preheated to 340°F (170°C) for around 20-30 minutes.
Check whether the pumpkin is soft enough by pricking it with a fork. Once cooked [4], pass the still-warm pumpkin through a potato ricer into a large bowl [5]. Crumble the amaretti cookies into a fine powder [6] and then add them to the bowl, too.
Next add the chopped Mantua mustard [7], grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [8], and lemon zest [9].
 
Then season with nutmeg [10], salt, and pepper [11]. Stir everything well to combine until you get a fairly dry and dense mixture [12]. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for around 8 hours.
 
To make the fresh pasta, pour the flour onto a pastry board and make a well in the middle [13], then lightly beat the eggs [14] and add them to the well along with a pinch of salt [15].
Using a fork, begin to take the flour from the sides and bring it toward the middle [16]. When the mixture starts to become consistent, continue to knead with your hands for around 5 minutes [17]. Shape the resulting dough into a little mound, wrap it in a clean dish towel or plastic wrap [18], and leave it to rest in the fridge for around 30 minutes.
After this resting time has passed, you can roll out the pasta: Flatten the mound with your hands [19], dust it with flour, and pass it through a pasta machine [20]. You will need to get a very thin sheet, so pass the dough as many times as necessary to get the smallest thickness, taking care to dust with flour every once in a while [21].
Divide the pasta sheet into 2-inch (5-6-cm) squares using a fluted pasta cutter wheel [22]. Place a dollop of pumpkin filling in the middle of each little square [23]. If the pasta is too dry for it to stick, you can spray it with a little water [24].
Close the tortelli by folding the square in half [25], and then press around the edges well with your fingers to seal [26]. Repeat these steps to form all of the pumpkin tortelli [27].
 
Now it’s time to cook them: Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan together with a few sage leaves [28]. Cook the tortelli in the boiling water for 1-2 minutes [29], then drain and add directly to the pan with the melted butter [30].
 
Give them a few flips in the pan to heat through and distribute the butter dressing [31], then plate up the tortelli and finish off with a sprinkling of grated Parmigiano Reggiano [32]. Your pumpkin tortelli are ready to be enjoyed [33]!
