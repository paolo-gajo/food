Limoncello is the very popular liqueur made with the peel of citrus fruits from Campania, traditionally prepared with lemons typical of the Amalfi Coast: Sfusato Amalfitano or Ovale di Sorrento. The history of limoncello is steeped in many legends and anecdotes. Its invention is in fact disputed by Sorrento, Amalfi and Capri. The first to register the "Limoncello" trademark in 1988 was the entrepreneur Massimo Canale, and in Capri, many claim that the liqueur is linked to the history of this family; in fact, it seems that this liqueur originated in the early 1900s from a recipe of his grandmother. Initially a homemade preparation, limoncello has gained great popularity since the 80s, and today it is commercially produced on a large scale. So much so that it has become a traditional festive gift. In fact, a bottle of limoncello makes a nice present both at Christmas and Easter, perhaps accompanied by colorful Easter cookies. The recipe for limoncello is simple, but it must be followed closely, and in just over a couple of months this fragrant yellow liqueur with a strong flavor can be enjoyed, most often as a digestive drink, but also to flavor desserts or fruit salads.
