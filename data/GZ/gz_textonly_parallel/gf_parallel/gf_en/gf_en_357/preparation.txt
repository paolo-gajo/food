To make the limoncello, wash the lemons under running water [1], rub the peel with a clean sponge to remove any dirt, then dry the lemons with a cloth [2]. Peel the lemons with a potato peeler, taking care to take only the yellow peel and notÂ the bitter white part known as the pith [3].
Pour the alcohol [4] and lemon peels [5] into an airtight glass jar, close the lid [6] and leave the peels to steep for 30 days in a dark place away from heat sources.
After 30 days, remove the peels and prepare the syrup: pour the water [7] and sugar [8] into a pan, bring the syrup to a boil and once it has started to boil [9],
turn off the heat, pour the syrup into a pitcher [10] and let it cool completely. Then add the syrup to the lemon peel jar [11]. Shake the jar to blend the syrup and alcohol, then leave it to rest [12] for a further 40 days, in the dark and away from heat sources.
Next, take the jar with the liqueur, shake it and pour the contents through a strainer (13-14), collecting the liqueur in a bottle using a funnel. Your homemade limoncello is ready to be enjoyed [15]!
