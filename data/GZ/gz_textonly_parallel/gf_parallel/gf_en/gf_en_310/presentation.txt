Rolled oats are the main ingredient of porridge, which is why they are often associated with breakfast: here we've used them to make delicious cookiesÂ and cute yogurt-filled baskets! Today we present you with a recipe that will be the perfect start to your day, a genuine snack, or a morish end to any meal: oat apple crumble! Two layers of crumble made with wholegrain flour that conceal a soft apple and cinnamon filling, for a dessert with an irresistibly rustic appearance, even more so with the chopped hazelnut sprinkling. If you too are a lover of crumbles, you certainly won't be disappointed with our version with apples and oats!
