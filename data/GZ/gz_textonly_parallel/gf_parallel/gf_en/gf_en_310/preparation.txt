To make oat apple crumble, start by preparing the crumble: place the wholegrain flour, rolled oats [1], granulated sugar [2] and muscovado sugar [3] in a capacious bowl,
along with the cold and diced butter [4] and a pinch of salt. Stir briskly with your finger tips [5] to obtain a crumbly mixture [6]. Leave in the refrigerator to rest for around 30 minutes.
Now prepare the filling: peel the apples, cut them in half and remove the core [7], then cut them into wedges [8] and lastly, thinly slice [9].
Place the apples in a bowl, add the muscovado sugar [10], the cinnamon [11] and stir with a spoon [12].
Now take an 8" (20 cm) cake mold, line with parchment paper and add half of the crumble mixture [13]: try to create an even layer by gently pressing it down with your fingers. Spread the filling over the base, leave a 0.4 inch (1 cm) space along the edge [14] and then cover with the remaining crumble mixture [15].
Press the surface down with your finger tips [16] and sprinkle with the chopped hazelnuts [17]. Bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F (180°C) for around 35 minutes. Once baked, remove your oat apple crumble from the oven and leave it to cool thoroughly before enjoying it [18]!
