To prepare the swordfish and mint pasta, finely chop the parsley [1]. Cut the swordfish [2] to obtain cubes of 1 inch (2 cm) [3].
In a pan pour a drizzle of oil, add a few sprigs of mint and an unpeeled garlic clove [4]. Add the chopped parsley and a pinch of salt [6].
Add the swordfish [7] and let it sizzle before adding salt and pepper, and removing the garlic [8]. After a few minutes it will be white and soft, then deglaze with brandy [9]: flame the mixture by tilting the pan on the stove. Pay close attention to the flame.
As soon as the alcohol has evaporated, set the swordfish aside, covered with a plate [10]. Clean the onion and slice it [11]. Then cut the tomatoes into 4 parts [12]. 
Boil some water to cook the pasta while in the previous pan, pour a little more oil, the onion and brown it with a pinch of salt [13]. Add the cherry tomatoes [14] and chopped mint and basil [15].
After 5 minutes of cooking, add white wine [16] and when the alcohol has evaporated, lower the heat and let it cook. Meanwhile, in another pan pour the breadcrumbs [17] and let toast, stirring constantly. Once golden brown, turn off the heat and continue stirring for a few more moments. Then add a drop of oil, mix again [18].
Keep stirring until it is crumbly [19], then set aside. Switch to the eggplant: wash it, trim and slice it [20]. Cut it into cubes roughly as big as the swordfish ones [21]. 
Heat some extra virgin olive oil and fry the diced eggplant a little at a time [22]. Once it turns golden brown, drain on absorbent paper [23]. TIme to cook the paccheri in boiling salted water [24].
Pour the swordfish [25], the eggplant [26] in the cherry tomatoes and add a ladleful of pasta water [27].
Drain paccheri al dente, pour it in the sauce [28] and finish cooking, stirring often and being careful not to break the paccheri [29]. One last stir and turn the heat off [30].
Serve by adding the toasted breadcrumbs [31], a basil leaf [32] and mint to each plate. Your swordfish and mint pasta is ready [33].
