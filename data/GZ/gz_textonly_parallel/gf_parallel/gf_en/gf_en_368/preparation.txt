To make the lasagne with sausage ragu, first peel the carrot, onion, and celery and chop them roughly [1]. Add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to a frying pan [2], then add the chopped vegetables and brown over high heat for at least 5 minutes [3]. 
Meanwhile, take the sausage, make an incision in the skin [4] and remove it carefully using your hands [5]. Once the vegetables have turned golden brown, add the sausage to the pan [6],
increase the heat, and break up the sausage using a wooden spoon [7]. Let it brown for about 5 minutes. Then, pour in the red wine [8] and simmer until it evaporates completely. Next, add the tomato puree [9],
season with salt and pepper [10], and stir to combine [11]. Cover the pan with a lid [12] and cook for about 10 minutes. 
In the meantime, start making the béchamel sauce: Pour the milk into a saucepan, season with salt and add the nutmeg [13], then bring to a boil. Melt the butter in another small saucepan [14], then sprinkle in the flour [15],
stirring quickly using a whisk [16]. Next, add the hot milk [17] and, stirring continuously, cook the béchamel until it has thickened [18].
Once the ragu is ready [19], all you have to do is assemble the lasagne. Spread a little béchamel on the bottom of a 9x13 inch (20x30 cm) pan and arrange the lasagne sheets on top [20]. Cover with the sausage ragu, another layer of béchamel [21],
and a tablespoon of grated Grana Padano cheese [22]. Repeat these steps another five times [23], alternating the direction of the lasagne sheets [24] each time.
Once you’ve put the final layer of pasta in place, cover with the remaining ragu sauce [25], béchamel [26], and Grana Padano [27]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 425°F (220°C) for 20 minutes, then switch to broil mode at the highest setting and cook for another 3 minutes. 
When the lasagne with sausage ragu is golden brown, take it out of the oven [28], decorate with oregano and thyme leaves [29], and serve [30]!
