Ragu alla bolognese is surely one of the best-loved sauces when it comes to making lasagne. But this week, for Sunday lunch, we’ve got an ace up our sleeve. Your friends and family will be wowed when you place a steaming pan of this lasagne with sausage ragu on the table!  Sausage is much more flavorful than ground meat, plus it doesn’t crumble apart once cooked like ground meat does; it stays dense and with every bite, it gives you a truly special flavor and nuance. Even though the sausages you can find might vary from place to place and some contain more spices than others, don’t worry – whichever kind you use, this dish is bound to be a hit! The layers of pasta alternate with layers of the ragu and creamy béchamel sauces, just like in the traditional lasagne recipes... but do you prefer to follow tradition to the letter or are you open to putting a little twist on it, as we’ve done here? And if you happen to end up with some leftover sausage ragu, try using it on bucatini pasta!
