To prepare spaghetti carbonara start by putting a pot of salted water on the burner to cook the pasta. In the meantime, remove the pork rind from the guanciale [1] and cut it first into slices and then into strips about 1/2" (1cm)Â  [2] thick. The removed rind can be reused to flavor other things. Put the pieces into a non-stick pan [3] and brown for about 15 minutes over medium heat, being careful not to burn it or it will smell too strong.
Meanwhile, put spaghetti in boiling water [4] and cook for the time indicated on the package. In the meantime, pour the yolks into a bowl [5], add most of the Pecorino cheese needed for the recipe and the remaining part will be used just before serving.
Season with black pepper [7] and whip by hand [8]. Add a tablespoon of cooking water to dilute the mixture and stir [9].
In the meantime the guanciale will be cooked, turn off the burner and set it aside [10]. Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan with the guanciale [11] and stir it briefly to season it. Remove from heat and pour the mixture of eggs and pecorino cheese [12] into the pan. Mix quickly to combine.
To make it very creamy, if necessary, you can add a little cooking water to your pasta [13]. Serve spaghetti carbonara immediately with the remaining pecorino cheese [14] and ground black pepper [15] on top.
