For those who know Rome well, Vicolo della Scrofa is one of the most characteristic streets, rich in symbolism. It seems that the first Carbonara was made in 1944 in a trattoria there, hence the name of the alley. The most reliable story in fact relates the encounter between the ingredients available to the American soldiers and the imagination of a Roman cook. The result was the prototype of spaghetti alla carbonara: eggs, bacon (later guanciale) and cheese. Gradually the recipe evolved to the one we all know and love today and we can appreciate it in our Roman (and voracious!) friends' homes, in a trattorias or in starred restaurants of the capital alike, throughout Italy and abroad, in countless versions: with or without pepper, with one yolk per person or the addition of at least one whole egg, with guanciale or strips of bacon. The carbonara sauce is prepared in a matter of minutes. Just think that all you need is spicy guanciale cut into strips, a golden cream made with yolks (in our version) and a lot of grated Pecorino cheese. With its simplicity and the richness of ingredients, the recipe for spaghetti carbonara is closely related to three other cornerstones of genuine Italian cuisine: the amatriciana, the gricia and spaghetti cacio e pepe! This is so true that there is even a recipe that combines all those recipes together, called pasta alla zozzona.
