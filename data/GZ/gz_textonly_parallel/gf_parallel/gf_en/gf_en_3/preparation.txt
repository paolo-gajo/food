To make zucchini, tomato and sausage lasagna, start by preparing the tomatoes: wash the cherry tomatoes and place them whole on a tray lined with parchment paper. Season with oil [1], salt, brown sugar, the sprigs of thyme, dried oregano and pepper to taste [2]. Bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 290°F (145°C) for around 120 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the béchamel: heat the milk in a saucepan [3], then add a pinch of salt and the nutmeg.
Separately, melt the butter on low heat [4], remove from the heat and add the flour in one go [5], beat with a whisk to avoid the formation of lumps. Return to low heat, stir until golden. Incorporate the hot milk [6] and cook for 5-6 minutes on low heat.
Continue stirring with the whisk until the béchamel becomes dense [7]. Now prepare the sauce: finely chop a shallot [8], wash and cut the zucchini in half lengthwise, then cut them into slices that are around half an inch thick [9].
Remove the sausage casing and crumble the meat by hand [10]. Pour a drizzle of oil in a large pan and brown the shallot on low heat [11]. Add the sausage [12] and brown for a few more minutes.
Now add the zucchini [13], the tomato paste [14], salt, pepper and cook for around 8-10 minutes on medium heat. Now remove from the heat and leave to one side [15].
In the meantime, the tomatoes will have finished baking [16]. Take an 8"x12" (20X30 cm) oven tray, drizzle a little oil on the bottom [17] and add a spoon of  béchamel [18].
Now arrange 3 of the 12 dry lasagna sheets [19] on the bottom and cover with part of the sausage and zucchini sauce [20]. Sprinkle the cherry tomatoes over it [21].
Flavor with a spoon of grated Grana Padano [22]. Proceed with another layer of pasta, béchamel, cherry tomatoes and Grana Padano. Continue until all the ingredients run out [24]; with these amounts you will make 4 layers in total.
The last layer must consist of bechamel, zucchini and sausage sauce, tomatoes and Grana Padano [26]. Bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 400°F (205°C) for 25 minutes. Once baked, remove the zucchini, tomato and sausage lasagna, and leave to cool slightly before serving [27].
