It is impossible to resist a rich, appetizing and piping hot lasagna! A timeless Sunday dish which you'll find here in a new version: zucchini, tomato and sausage lasagna. Simply describing this delicacy tantalizes the taste buds: between the sheets of pasta lies a meat sauce that expresses itself with spring notes, made from zucchini and sausage. The tomato confit, slowly roasted in the oven with aromatic herbs, will add a sweet and sour and refined touch to the dish. If you too feel it's just not Sunday without a lasagna, then try this appetizing version!
