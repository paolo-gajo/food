This dough is so versatile, it’s sublime as a savory and irresistible as a sweet! The Danubio dolce is a kind of brioche made from slowly leavened dough. In this recipe, it’s filled with smooth pastry cream. This creation is a feast for the eyes and cries out to be shared with friends and children, perhaps at a party! The Danubio is made up of many soft balls of leavened dough that can be torn off with your hands. But the surprises don’t end here: each ball contains a delicious filling! There are many varieties of Danubio: in Naples, for example, it is prepared with a tasty filling of diced cooked ham and cheese, while we have also used the method as inspiration for a delicious tart recipe with fresh cherries. Try jazzing up this sweet Danubio variant by filling a few balls with chocolate pastry cream, jelly, or hazelnut paste!
