Only a chef of Neapolitan origin could reveal all the secrets to make fried mozzarella: a delicious recipe, widespread also in Lazio with some differences, very easy to prepare that requires small touches to obtain a perfect result. Chef Andrea Aprea will show you in a few fundamental steps. First of all, the quality of the ingredients, especially for the mozzarella, which must be buffalo mozzarella and preferably from the day before. Fried mozzarella, in fact, was created as a recipe for recycling everything left over from the previous lunch and turning it into something really appetizing! These fritters with a fragrant shell and a filled core will please everyone thanks to their simplicity, but if you want to make a gourmet version, Chef Aprea recommends adding anchovies, dried tomatoes, basil and black pepper inside. An explosion of flavors that you can enhance by breading with panko, special Japanese breadcrumbs instead of classic breadcrumbs, the resulting crunchiness will conquer everyone bite after bite!
