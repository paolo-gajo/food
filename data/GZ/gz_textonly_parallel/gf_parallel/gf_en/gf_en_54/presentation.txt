It is said that some of the best ideas come from mistakes, and this is exactly what has often happened to great people in history. Even in the kitchen, certain mistakes have made someone's fortune. An example is the torta caprese (chocolate cake), the cake invented by Carmine Di Fiore around 1920, who forgot to add flour to the mixture. But once the dessert was out of the oven, thanks to its wonderful moist and soft texture as well as its natural absence of gluten, it became a huge success. The rest, as they say, is history. And in fact, torta caprese (chocolate cake) has won people over from that fateful mistake, to the point of becoming one of the icons of traditional Campania pastry-making.
