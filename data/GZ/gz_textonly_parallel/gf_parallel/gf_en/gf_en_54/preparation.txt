To prepare torta caprese (chocolate cake), start by placing the butter at room temperature into a bowl (take it out of the fridge at least a couple of hours before using it), half of the sugar [1] and the seeds scraped off half a vanilla bean [2]. Using a handheld mixer on medium-high speed, whisk the butter and after 6-7 minutes add the pinch of salt and egg yolks. The eggs should also be left at room temperature for at least 12 hours [3].
After a few minutes the mixture will be frothy [4], so turn off the mixer, clean the bowl with a spatula collecting all the mixture and set it aside [5]. In another bowl mix the dry ingredients: add the grated chocolate, the powdered almonds [6],
and the powdered hazelnuts [7]. Next, sift the potato starch, baking powder [8] and bitter cocoa powder [9].
Mix everything well and set aside [10]. In another bowl pour the egg whites and the remaining powdered sugar [11]. Make sure that the whisks are clean, otherwise the egg whites will not whip [12].
After a few minutes the egg whites will be shiny and frothy: you don't have to whip them stiff, but they need to hold the classic bird beak [13]. When all preparations are complete, preheat the oven to 340째F (170째C) in convection mode and start combining them: fold a third of the whipped egg whites [14] then a third of the dry ingredients [15] into the egg yolks and butter mixture
using a spatula, stirring gently from bottom to top [16]. Add another third of the egg whites and one third of the dry ingredients [17] and continue until you get a uniform mixture [18].
Pour the smooth and creamy mixture into a 9-inch (22 cm) round cake mold already buttered and floured with potato starch [19]. Carefully level the surface [20] and bake in a convection oven at 340째F (170째C) for about 45 minutes [21].
Once baked, let the cake cool down in the mold, then turn it upside down to unmold it [23]. Then turn it over again on a plate lined with baking paper and let it cool completely [24]. Once cold, turn the cake upside down one last time, remove the baking paper and dust the surface with powdered sugar. Your torta caprese (chocolate cake) is ready to be enjoyed [25]!
