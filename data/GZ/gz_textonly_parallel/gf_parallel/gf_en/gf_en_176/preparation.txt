Before you start preparing the friedÂ ricotta cheese balls with sauce, drain the whey from the sheep's milk ricotta by placing it in a narrow mesh strainer in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours, preferably overnight. Then proceed as follows: remove the crust of the bread, cut the soft part out [1] and then finely chop it in the mixer [2]. Meanwhile, take the ricotta cheese and sieve it with a narrow mesh strainer [3].
Place the chopped crumbs in a large bowl with the sifted ricotta cheese [4], then add the crushed half clove of garlic [5] and whole beaten eggs [6].
Add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and pecorino cheese [7], parsley, salt [8] and pepper to taste. Then mix all the ingredients well with a fork [9].
Mix well until soft but compact [10]. Put a little oil on the palms of your hands [11] and, taking a portion of the dough, form meatballs of about 1 3/4 tbsp (30 g) each [12].
Continue until you have about 25 pieces [13]. Set aside and proceed with the preparation of the sauce: brown the oil and a clove of garlic in a pan [14]; once the garlic is golden, remove it from the heat [15].
Add the tomato puree [16], a pinch of salt and basil leaves [17], then add pepper to taste [18].
Bring the sauce to a boil over low heat, then add the ricotta meatballs you have prepared [19], distributing them evenly. Leave to cook for about 10 minutes over low heat [20]. Once the time has elapsed, turn off and serve the ricotta cheese balls with sauce while hot [21].
