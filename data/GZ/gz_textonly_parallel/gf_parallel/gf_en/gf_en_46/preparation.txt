To prepare the Tuscan chestnut cake, first wash the raisins in fresh water and soak them in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes to rehydrate them [1]. Coarsely chop the walnut kernels with a knife [2], then peel off the fresh rosemary needles [3].
Sift the chestnut flour into a large bowl [4] and add the 2 3/4 cups (650,g) of water a little at a time, stirring with a hand whisk [5]; when the mixture is smooth and homogeneous, add the chopped walnuts and whole pine nuts [6], making sure to set a small amount aside that will later be used on top of the cake before baking.
After 10 minutes, squeeze and dry the raisins, then add them to the mixture [7], adding a small amount at a time; mix well [8] and add salt [9].
Oil a 12 inch (32 cm) low round cake tin  [10] and pour the mixture, leveling it with a spatula [11]. Sprinkle the surface of the cake with the pine nuts, walnuts and raisins set aside, distributing them evenly [12].
Lastly, add the rosemary needles [13], a drizzle of oil, [14] and cook in a static oven preheated to 380° F (195° C) for approximately 35 minutes. When a crust forms cracks on the surface and the nuts have a nice golden color, take the cake out. When cool, serve and enjoy the Tuscan chestnut cake [15].
