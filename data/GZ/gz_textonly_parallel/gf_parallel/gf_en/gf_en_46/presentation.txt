The castagnaccio, baldino or pattona chestnut cake is a traditional dessert made with chestnut flour and raisins, pine nuts, walnuts, and rosemary. It is difficult to determine its exact origin. We have made a Tuscan-style chestnut cake, but this recipe is also used in Veneto, Piedmont, and Lombardy, all regions in which the chestnut is a popularly used ingredient. All of its variations share the simple ingredients of chestnut cake itself: water, chestnut flour, and rosemary. Chestnuts were already so well-known and appreciated in the sixteenth century that an Augustinian priest discussed it in one of his writings. It seems that the creator of the chestnut cake was the Tuscan Pilade da Lucca, who is mentioned in the "Commentary of the most notable and monstrous things of Italy and other places" written by Ortensio Orlando, published in Venice in 1553. However, it was in the 19th century that the Tuscans exported the chestnut cake to the rest of Italy, and it was in this period that it was enhanced with raisins, pine nuts, and rosemary. Each family has its own chestnut cake recipe, but here we will share our version with you!
