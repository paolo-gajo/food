To prepare the classic mimosa cake you first need to make the two sponge cakes. Make sure you have two 8" (20 cm) diameter pans and that both fit into the oven on the same shelf next to each other. If this is not the case, you will have to make one sponge cake at a time (just halve the indicated amounts). Preheat the oven to 325° F (160°) in static mode. Crack open the eggs, put them in a stand mixer and start whipping them at moderate speed [1]. Cut both the vanilla pods, take out the seeds [2] and add them to the mixing bowl with a pinch of salt. At this point slowly add the sugar [3]. 
Continue to whip for about 15 minutes until the eggs have tripled in volume and you have obtained a fluid and creamy mixture, slightly thickened [4]. Stop the mixer and place a strainer directly over the bowl. Sift together the flour [5] and starch [6] 
and gently fold the powder in with upward movements from the bottom using a spatula [7], so as not to risk separating the mixture. When it is homogeneous [8], butter and flour the two 8" (20 cm) diameter cake pans. Divide the dough equally between the 2 cake pans [9].
Bake your sponge cake in a static oven preheated to 325° F (160° C), on the lower shelf, for about 50 minutes [10]. Make sure they are baked by testing with a toothpick; if it emerges completely dry, you can take them out of the oven [11]. Let them cool completely before you take them out of the pan [12]. Then place them on a cooling rack to finish cooling.
