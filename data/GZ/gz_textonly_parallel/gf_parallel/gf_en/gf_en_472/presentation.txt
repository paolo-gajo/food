March 8th is a special day. We pay homage to women with a flower the color of the sun and a sweet scent... or with a cake that preserves the same features: the mimosa cake! The name of this cake derives from being decorated with crumbled sponge cake: this recalls the bunches of the beautiful spring flower. For the mimosa cake you need to make two sponge cakes, one will be filled with a delicious custard mixed with whipped cream to make a soft diplomatic cream. The other sponge cake will be needed to cover the base: small cubes that will be used to cover the cake to create the "mimosa" effect. Make this cake for an evening with friends, for the women of the family or to enjoy whenever you feel like having this timeless cake!
