To prepare tomato sauce, start by checking the tomatoes one by one, to made sure there aren't any spoiled ones, with bruises or spots. Wash them thoroughly [1] and remove the stalks. Cut each tomato in half lengthwise [2] and squeeze to remove the middle part with the seeds [3].
Continue in this way and collect all the tomatoes in one bowl and the juice in another [4]. Below you will find lots of ideas on how to reuse it! Now place the tomatoes in a large saucepan [5] and lightly sweat them on a low flame for around 30 minutes, stirring occasionally [6].
When the tomatoes have nicely wilted [7], add salt. Stir and wait a little longer [8]. Now blend a few tomatoes at a time in a tomato press, on a fine to medium setting [9].
Place the puree in a bowl [10]. In the meantime, finely chop the carrot [11] and the onion [12].
Add a drizzle of oil and then the finely chopped vegetables to the saucepan you cooked the tomatoes in [13]. Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Now add the tomato puree [14] and cook for another 30 minutes on a low flame, stirring occasionally [15].
Make sure the sauce is the right density [16] and place it in a container [17]; add a basil leaf [18] and use it as you like!
