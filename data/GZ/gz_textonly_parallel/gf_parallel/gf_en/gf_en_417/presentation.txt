Simple and flavorsome, fresh tomato sauce is the Mediterranean condiment par excellence. Summer is the best time of the year for making it, especially in the months of July and August, when tomatoes have nicely ripened, bursting with flavor and aroma. To make a good sauce the first thing you need to do is to prepare some home made puree; choose whatever variety of tomato you prefer. After doing so, you'll need to flavor the puree with some finely chopped vegetables or garlic cloves and cook to your desired density! Once the fresh tomato sauce is ready you can use it to flavor lots of different types of pasta, like classic spaghetti, or even a delicious risotto!
