To prepare the tiramisu bundt cake, make coffee with a moka pot and let it cool down. Pour the sugar and eggs [1] into a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer for a couple of minutes [2]. When they are puffy and frothy, add a pinch of salt [3]
and mascarpone cheese [4]. Whisk again with the electric mixer for a few seconds. Add sifted flour [5] and baking powder [6].
Incorporate the flour and baking powder by stirring the mixture with a spatula [7], until it becomes smooth and homogeneous [8]. Now, divide the batter into three equal parts in three separate bowls [9].
In one of the 3 bowls, add sifted cocoa powder and 20g of coffee [10]. Mix with a spatula [12] to combine all the ingredients.
In another bowl, pour the remaining coffee [13] and mix with a spatula to homogenize the batter [14]. Pour milk into the white batter [15]
and mix it together. You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter [16]. Butter and flour a 20 cm diameter and 22 cm surface bundt cake mold. Take the cocoa batter and pour it onto the bottom of the mold [17]. Spread it all over the surface, then place the coffee batter on top [18], spreading it over the entire surface as well.
Lastly, do the same thing with the white batter [19]. This way, you will get 3 different layers [20]. Bake in a preheated static oven at 180Â°C for about 40 minutes in the middle rack. Take it out of the oven [21] and let it cool completely.
Then, remove the bundt cake from the pan and transfer it to a serving dish [22]. Dust with unsweetened cocoa [23] and serve your tiramisu bundt cake [24].
