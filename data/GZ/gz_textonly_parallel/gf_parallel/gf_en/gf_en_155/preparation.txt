To prepare the sausage and provolone pork loin rolls, start by rinsing the porcini mushrooms thoroughly, before soaking them for 10-15 minutes in warm water [1] so that they rehydrate. Cut 6 slices from the loin and tenderize them with a meat tenderizer (2-3).
Keeping the skin on the sausage, cut it into 6 pieces of around 4 inches (9 cm) in length, or the same width as the meat slices [4]. Next, cut 12 pretty thin slices of provolone [5]. Season the slices with salt and pepper, lay the sausage on top [6]
and cover with a couple of slices of provolone [7]. Roll the whole thing up [8] and fasten with kitchen string [9].
Dredge the rolls in the flour [10] and set aside for a moment. Pour a drizzle of oil and the butter into a frying pan [11]. Allow it to melt, then add the herbs and spices: the sage, the rosemary, and the whole clove of garlic, peeled [12].
Place the rolls in the pan and brown them [13], turning often, over medium heat until the meat is well sealed on all sides. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then drain the mushrooms well [14] and add to the rolls [15].
Add the Marsala wine [16], and as soon as the alcohol has evaporated (this will only take a few moments) [17], pour in the light cream [18].
Cover with a lid [19] and cook over low heat for around 20 minutes. Add a little water at a time [20], if necessary, to prevent the cooking liquid from becoming too thick. Once cooked, everything should be creamy. Serve your sausage and provolone pork loin rolls piping hot [21].
