Savory roulades have to be up there with the tastiest of main courses. As well as all the goodness of veal, pork, chicken, or turkey, they also boast a rich, melting filling and delicious combinations of ingredients like the one we’ve chosen for this recipe: sausage and provolone pork loin rolls. Thin slices of pork loin wrapped around a very simple filling made with sausage and provolone cheese make for a succulent, appetizing dish with a captivating flavor, but the real trump card with these rolls is the sauce! Mushrooms and cream create a winning combination, with an aromatic note courtesy of the Marsala wine. Don’t worry if you like your rolls in a thicker sauce, though, as you can vary them to your liking by stewing them or using other seasonal vegetables to create a different main course every time!
