To prepare stewed cod, start by desalinating the capers: rinse them thoroughly under running water. Now check there are no bones in the fish. Run your fingers along the surface of the cut of fish and if you find any, remove them with pincers [1]. Now cut the cod into 4 pieces, each around 1.2 inches in size, without removing the skin, as it will keep the fish intact during cooking [2]. Lastly, peel and thinly slice the onion [3].
Heat a saucepan on the stove. Add the oil and then the onion; brown on a low flame, stirring occasionally, for around 4-5 minutes [4]. Once softened, leave the onion to one side, without gathering up the oil too [5] and quickly dredge the cod pieces with flour. Be sure to remove any excess flour [6].
Turn the flame up and add the cod pieces [7] and cook for 1-2 minute per side: turn the pieces over when golden [8]. Add the white wine, simmer [9]
and reduce, then turn the flame down a little and add the tomato puree [10]. Add the onions to the condiment [11], followed by the olives and desalinated capers [12],
flavor with the oregano [13] and lastly, add a pinch of salt and pepper [14]. Stir delicately [15],
put the lid on [16] and cook for around 40 minutes on a low flame [17]. Your stewed cod is now ready, all you need to do is add some fresh parsley to taste and enjoy it with a few slices of bread [18].
