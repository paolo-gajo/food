To prepare the farinata, put the chickpea flour [1] in a bowl and form a mound with a well in the middle. Pour water at room temperature [2] into the well a little at a time. Mix everything thoroughly, taking care not to form lumps, until the mixture is liquid and uniform [3].
Cover the mixture with plastic wrap [4] and leave to rest outside the fridge from 4/5 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally. After this time, you will notice some foam on the surface; remove this with a skimmer [5] and stir [6].
Add ¼ cup (50 g) of oil [7] and salt [8] to the mixture and stir again [9].
Oil three 8-inch (32-cm) baking pans with the remaining oil (the pans used are traditionally copper or aluminum, but you can also use an ordinary nonstick pan). Use a ladle to spread the chickpea mixture over the pans [10]. Smooth to an even thickness with the aid of a fork [11] to ensure uniform cooking, then bake in a conventional oven preheated to 480°F (250°C) Bake in the lower part of the oven, in contact with the bottom, for the first 10 minutes. If using a convection oven, bake for just 7-8 minutes at 430°F (220°C) and then follow the rest of the steps indicated. After this time, move the pan to the top part of the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes, depending on your oven, until the farinata [12] is a nice golden-brown color. Take the farinata out of the oven and enjoy it piping hot, sprinkling it with black pepper to taste.
