Start by making the sauce. Finely chop the shallot [1] and brown on a low flame [2]. Now peel the garlic too, add it to the shallot and cook for at least 6-7 minutes [3].
Add the tomato puree [4], then the salt and pepper; leave to cook for at least 40 minutes, with the lid on [5]. As the sauce cooks, prepare the meatballs: Place the crust-free stale wholegrain bread in a mixer together with the mortadella [6].
Slice into the sausage with a sharp knife to remove the casing [7] and finely chop it [8]. Finely chop the parsley too [9].
Place the minced pork [10], soft part of bread with mortadella [11], sausage [12]
and the parsley [13] in a large bowl. Add salt [14] and pepper [15] to taste.
Flavor with the grated nutmeg [16], add the egg [17] and grated cheese [18].
Now mix the ingredients thoroughly by hand [19]. Cover and leave to rest in the refrigerator for around 15 minutes. Then take the meatball mix and roll into 0.35 oz balls [20], you should make 42 in total. When the sauce is ready, remove the garlic and carefully add the meatballs to the sauce. Leave to cook for another 30 minutes, on a low flame [21].
Lastly, bring the water to the boil, add salt and then the pasta [22]; drain when firm to the bite and finish cooking it in the sauce [23]. Now your spaghetti and meatballs is ready [24].
