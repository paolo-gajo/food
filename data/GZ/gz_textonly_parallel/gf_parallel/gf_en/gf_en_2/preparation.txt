To make your zucchini with mint and vinegar (alla scapece), start by topping, tailing, and washing the zucchini. Next, cut them into rounds approximately ? inch (3 mm) thick [1], transfer to a colander, and sprinkle with 1 tbsp (20 g) of fine salt [2]. Stir and cover with a dish towel [3], leaving the liquid to drain from the vegetables for at least 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, rinse the zucchini under running water [4], then leave them to dry thoroughly on a dish towel [5]. Next, prepare the zucchini dressing: Pour the oil into a bowl, add the white wine vinegar [6],
add salt [7], emulsify it all together, then add the previously washed and chopped mint [8], the peeled and chopped garlic cloves, pepper to taste [9], and mix everything together.
Heat some oil for frying and fry a few zucchinis at a time [10], for around 5 minutes, until golden brown [11]. In the meantime, prepare a wide, shallow casserole dish in which you’ll spread the first layer of dressing [12].
As you drain the zucchini, pour them hot into the casserole dish [13], and layer them with alternating layers of the dressing (14-15). Serve your zucchini alla scapece once they’ve cooled completely (at least a couple of hours) or even while still slightly warm.
