We’ve all sampled them at least once in Naples, but zucchini with mint and vinegar (zucchini alla scapece) are, in fact, one of the tastiest side dishes you’ll find anywhere! The name “a scapece” probably dates back to the days of Spanish domination and the term “escabechar”, meaning “to souse”, since the fried zucchini are dipped in an emulsion of oil, wine vinegar, parsley, and garlic while still hot. The scapece dressing is very similar to carpione, a Piedmontese marinade, both originally created to preserve food (especially fish and meat, and later also vegetables) and having since become traditional and authentic recipes. Zucchini with mint and vinegar are great served as an appetizer with toasted bread, or as a side dish, especially with fish dishes such as our swordfish rolls.
