Nutella roll is a classic dessert: a delectable spiral of soft cookie dough encasing everyone’s favorite hazelnut spread! The texture and taste of this soft mixture are reminiscent of sponge cake, but in roll form, it becomes an exquisite parcel of deliciousness that will appeal to young and old! Serve it in slices as a tasty snack to celebrate children’s birthdays, perhaps paired with cute Mars Bar cake cubes or for family parties, like Halloween. Have fun decorating the cake with different stencils to suit the occasion… unleash your creativity on this blank canvas! But don’t expect to admire it for long. This Nutella roll will be gone in a flash!
