In the kitchen there are ingredients that are made to stay together, pairs of indissoluble flavors that make every recipe a certainty. For the savory we think of ham and cheese or ricotta and spinach; for dessert, coconut and Nutella or strawberries and Champagne come to mind… But for the sweet tooth, we have chosen a truly dizzying combination: chocolate toffee tartlets! A sin of gluttony in single-portion format made with a cocoa shortbread base that encloses a very sweet layer of toffee sauce, hidden in turn by a covering of ganache cream. The creaminess of dark chocolate envelops the unmistakable sweetness of caramel in a voluptuous and seductive embrace, enhanced on the finish by the savory note of salt flakes. An unexpected but pleasant contrast, which gives the dessert a balanced, intense and harmonious taste. And that gives us a further certainty: with the chocolate toffee tartlets it will be love at first bite!
