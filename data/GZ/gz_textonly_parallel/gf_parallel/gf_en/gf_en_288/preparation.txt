To prepare panettone, start by making the starter dough. Place the flour, crumbled brewer's yeast [1], malt [2] and the milk at room temperature [3] in a bowl.
Stir with a spatula [4], then place on a work top and knead by hand. You should obtain a compact piece of dough [5]. Place it back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap [6] and leave to rest for an hour at room temperature, before placing it in the refrigerator for 12 hours.
