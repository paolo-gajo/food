Pear and chocolate is a sublime treat, a morish pairing that features in countless tempting desserts we simply cannot resist: from the classic pear and chocolate cake, to the exotic pear and chocolate amaretti pie, without forgetting the refined chocolate tart with pears and pecan nuts. There's no stopping us and our desire to try out a new recipe in which pears and chocolate reign supreme: pear and chocolate pound cake. At first sight you may be forgiven for mistaking it for a simple chocolate pound cake: in truth it conceals a soft heart of fruit, which it unveils as soon as the first slice is cut. Its soft consistency, the enveloping and intense flavor of chocolate pleasantly contrasts the sweet pulp of pears that feature whole in this dessert. Pear and chocolateÂ pound cake is a veritable seduction of the palate, the perfect dessert for your special occasions...all you need to do is give in to the temptation!
