To prepare the soft tiramisu tart, start by making the cream. In a bowl, pour the mascarpone cheese and powdered sugar [1]. Mix with an electric whisk until obtaining a creamy consistency [2]. Soak the gelatin in cold water. Then pour the cream in a separate bowl, setting aside 20 grams for dissolving the gelatin. Whip it with the electric whisk, well-cleaned [3].
Heat the reserved cream, and as soon as it is warm, add the squeezed gelatin [4] and stir until it dissolves [5]. Wait a few moments so it's not too hot, then pour it into the mascarpone mixture while continuing to mix with the electric beaters [6].
Now gradually add the fresh liquid cream [7] and gently incorporate it with a spatula, stirring from the bottom upwards [8]. Then divide the cream into two bowls. In the first one, add the coffee at room temperature [9]
and stir [10]. In the second bowl, add the unsweetened cocoa powder [11] and mix until it's evenly combined [12].
Next, divide the coffee mixture into a mold with 3 cm (1 inch) half-spheres [13], making 8 spheres. Then pour the cocoa mixture into another half-sphere mold, this time with 5 cm (2 inch) spheres [14], making 5 spheres. Place the molds in the freezer to firm up for at least 30 minutes or until the tart is ready and chilled. To keep them level, place them on a tray [15].
Meanwhile, make the base. In a bowl, combine the butter and sugar [16], then use an electric mixer to work the ingredients until they are creamy in texture [17]. Add the eggs [18] and continue to mix until the mixture is smooth.
Continuing to mix with the electric whisk, add the coffee, which shouldn't be hot [19], the flour [20], and the sifted baking powder [21].
When you obtain a smooth mixture, add the cocoa [22] and incorporate it with the electric whisk. Then, butter a 22 cm (9 inch) diameter wavy edge pan and pour the mixture inside [23], leaving 1 cm (0.4'') from the edge. Smooth the surface with a spatula [24]. Bake in a preheated static oven at 180°C (356°F) for 35 minutes.
Before baking the dessert, always do the toothpick test and once cooked, let it cool at room temperature [25]. When the dessert is completely cold, unmold it [26] and dust the edges with powdered sugar [27].
Now, whip the cream for decoration [28] and transfer it to a pastry bag with a 12 mm (0.5'') star tip [29]. Then, take the cocoa half-spheres out of the freezer and gently remove them from the molds [30].
Place them on the tart [31], then take the coffee ones and remove them from the molds in the same way [32]. Place them on the tart, alternating them with the cocoa ones [33]. Since they are smaller, they will fit together and cover almost the entire surface of the tart.
Using a pastry bag filled with whipped cream, squeeze dollops into the remaining empty spaces [34], then dust with cocoa powder [35] and decorate with coffee beans [36]. Refrigerate and wait for about half an hour before serving your beautiful soft tiramisu tart!
