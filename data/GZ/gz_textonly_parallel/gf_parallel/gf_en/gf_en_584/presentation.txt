Think of the most popular homemade desserts: apple pie, strudel, pancakes... What’s the one thing they all have in common? Apples! The full sweetness of these fruits is only really released when they are cooked and become mouth-wateringly soft, and this is certainly true of this recipe for crostata di mele, or apple tart. A classic cake your grandma would make, with simple flavors the whole family loves, perfect for serving at the end of a meal as a dessert, or even to enjoy as a snack with a hot spiced tea when you need a sweet pick-me-up. A fragrant and crumbly tart dough case filled with an exquisite spiral of apples, patiently crafted, slice by slice, like the petals of a rose, creating a visual effect that’s easy to achieve and will bring a sophisticated twist to your homemade apple tart.
