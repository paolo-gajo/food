To prepare the vegan red lentil burgers, place the lentils in a pot [1], cover them with water about twice their volume, and add a small piece of kombu seaweed [2]. Cook for the time indicated on the package (about 20 minutes), remembering to add salt only towards the end of cooking [3] to prevent the lentils from becoming too firm.
Once cooked, drain the lentils without squeezing them [4]. Cut the scallion into very thin slices [5], heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan [6]
and gently sauté the scallion [7]. When it becomes almost transparent, add the lentils to the pan [8] and sauté them for a few minutes to enhance their flavor. Add the curry [9]
and pepper [10], and set aside. Cut the stale bread into small pieces [11]. In a large bowl, combine the lentils and bread [12] and mix well to fully soften the bread, using a spoon or even your hands.
When the bread is absorbed, add the chopped chives [13]. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mixture to firm up for at least an hour [14]. In the meantime, prepare the other ingredients for the vegan burgers. Wash the zucchini and cut them lengthwise into slices about 2-3 mm thick [15],
and do the same with the eggplant [16]. Heat the grill and sear the zucchini [17] and eggplant [18] on both sides until they have grill marks.
Also, wash the tomato and slice it [19]. Season the vegetables with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt, and set them aside. Now, let's work on the sauce: peel the avocado, remove the pit, and dice the flesh [20]. Squeeze the lemon juice [21],
and place both the avocado and lemon juice in the blender [22], along with the oil [23], salt, and garlic, crushed with a garlic press [24].
Blend until you get a smooth sauce [25], and set it aside. After the resting time, divide the lentil-based mixture into 4 balls, each about 90g, and flatten them in your hands to give them the classic hamburger shape [26], using a cookie cutter of the same diameter as the buns if you want a more even result. Then, return the burgers to the refrigerator to firm up for half an hour. After this time, brown the lentil burgers in a non-stick skillet with a drizzle of oil for 3-4 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking [27]: they should form a light crust.
When the burgers are cooked, you have everything you need to assemble your vegan burgers. Cut the buns in half [28], spread the avocado sauce on all the inner sides, and place a burger, a slice of tomato [29], and a slice of eggplant [30] on the bottom half, stacking them on top of each other.
Finally, add the zucchini [31] and a basil leaf [32]. Then, close with the top half of the bun so that the sauce-coated side is always in contact with the filling [33]. Proceed in the same way with all the burgers and heat them for 5 minutes in a preheated static oven at 200°C (390°F) to make the bread crispy. Your vegan red lentil burgers are ready to enjoy!
