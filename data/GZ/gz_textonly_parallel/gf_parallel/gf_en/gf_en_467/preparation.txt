To make your cod and potato casserole, start by preparing the sauce. Pour oil into a pan [1] and sizzle the garlic for a few minutes. Add the tomato purée [2], salt, and 1¼ tsp (5 g) of sugar [3].
Add the basil leaves [4], cover with a lid [5] and cook for 30 minutes over low heat. Now turn to the cod. Remove the bones with tweezers, cut into slices about ½ inch (1 cm) thick with a sharp knife, peel off the skin [6], and leave in the fridge covered with plastic wrap.
Peel the potatoes [7] and cut them with a mandolin to get slices about the thickness of a dime (1 mm) [8]. Add the breadcrumbs to a bowl and grate over the lemon zest [9].
Add the thyme leaves [10] and the seasoned salt (made by mixing the salt with pink, black, white, and green pepper to taste) [11], then stir to mix everything together. By this time, the sauce will have cooked, so turn off the heat and remove the garlic clove [12].
Now oil an 8x12-inch (30x20-cm) [13] casserole dish, spread your first layer of sauce on the bottom and place [14] one third of the potatoes on top, overlapping them slightly [15].
Spread the fragrant breadcrumb mixture [16] over the potatoes and then add the chopped cod [17]. Cover with more sauce [18] and keep alternating two more equal layers.
Finish with a layer of sauce and breadcrumbs [19]. Bake in an oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 60 minutes. When cooked, take the cod and potato casserole out of the oven [20], allow to cool slightly and then serve [21].
