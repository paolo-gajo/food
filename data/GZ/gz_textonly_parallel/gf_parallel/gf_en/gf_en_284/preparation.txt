To prepare paradise cake, start by placing the sieved flour, potato starch and yeast in a bowl [1], then stir thoroughly with a spoon. Place the pieces of softened butter in another bowl, add the pulp of half a vanilla seed [2] and grate the peel of half an untreated lemon [3];
grate the peel of half an untreated orange too [4]. Start beating the butter and vanilla with an electric whisk and add the powdered sugar [5]. When the mixture becomes light and airy in consistency, add the egg yolks (around 4 medium ones) [6],
then the salt [7], and continue to beat the mixture with the electric whisk, until soft and creamy. Leave to one side and place two whole eggs in another bowl, add the granulated sugar [8]; beat with an electric whisk and as soon as the egg and sugar mixture becomes light-colored, smooth and frothy [9],
add it to the butter, sugar and egg yolk mixture; alternate by adding the powders. Now add a little of the egg and sugar mixture [10] and stir thoroughly with a spatula. Add some of the powders [11] and continue to stir. Continue once more by adding some more of the powder to the liquid part, until there is none left [12]. Alternating both parts creates a dough with a typically crumbly consistency, which characterizes the paradise cake.
Take a 9.5 inch (24 cm) mold, use a brush to butter it [13], then coat in flour and add the paradise cake mix. Smooth with a spatula [15]
for an even surface [16]. Bake the paradise cake in a static oven preheated to 340°F (170°C) for around 45-50 minutes (this will depend on your oven; cover the cake with a sheet of aluminum after 30 minutes if you notice it is becoming too dark, and continue to bake). When done (always use the toothpick test to check), remove it from the oven [17] and wait around 20 minute before turning it over onto a serving dish [18].
Delicately remove the mold [19] and leave to cool thoroughly for around 1 hour. Once cooled, sprinkle with the powdered sugar [20] to create a homogeneous layer on the surface. Your paradise cake is ready to be enjoyed [21].
