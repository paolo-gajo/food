"This cake is paradise!" A famous exclamation by a noblewoman inspired the name of the eponymous cake made by Enrico Vigoni, a 19th century pastry chef from Pavia. This dessert became the symbol of Pavia and is a classic of Italian pastry making. We asked one of the most important Italian Master Pastry Chefs, Sal de Riso, to prepare it for us...or rather, for you! A mix of genuine and quality ingredients, like fresh eggs, untreated lemons and oranges, together with the Bourbon vanilla bean, bring to life a soft and fragrant base that is unmistakably delicious and sweet. What are the golden rules for a fabulous paradise cake? Mix all the ingredients together at the same temperature and alternate the addition of dry and liquid ingredients to the mix, for a dough that will cook to perfection and a cake this is not too airy or compact. Ideal enjoyed alone for a "heavenly" breakfast, sprinkled generously with powdered sugar, it is also a divine dessert when served with a layer of cream and topped with whipped cream, just like our version of lemon heaven cake. Fasten your aprons and get ready to enjoy this heavenly recipe!
