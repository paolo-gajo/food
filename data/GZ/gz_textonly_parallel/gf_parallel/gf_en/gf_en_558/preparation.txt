To make the banana cake, first chop up the walnuts [1] and set them aside in a small bowl. Next, peel the bananas and slice them, but not too thickly [2]. Put them in the mixer [3],  
blend to obtain a consistent pulp and set aside [4]. Beat the eggs with a hand mixer, adding the sugar a little at a time [5]. Continue to mix until the mixture has a frothy consistency and is light in color. You can then add the sifted flour to the mixture a little at a time, along with the baking powder, to prevent any lumps from forming [6].
Next, add the salt [7], drizzle in the oil [8] and add vanilla bean seeds [9]. 
Turn off the mixer and pour in the banana purée [10]. Mix well with a spatula, then do the same with the chopped walnuts [11]. Grease and flour a cake pan measuring 9 inches (22 cm) in diameter and pour in the mixture [12].
The cake is ready to be baked [13] in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for around 45 minutes. You can do the toothpick test to check that the cake is cooked, then remove it from the oven and allow to cool at room temperature [14]. Serve the banana cake with a sprinkling of icing sugar to taste [15].
