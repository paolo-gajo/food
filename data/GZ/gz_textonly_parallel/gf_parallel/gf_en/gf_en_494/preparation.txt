To make the chickpea burger, first cut the sandwich bread [1] into cubes. Then clean the shallot and slice it finely [2]. Drain the precooked chickpeas from their liquid [3].
Pour the chickpeas into the mixer, add the bread [4], beaten eggs [5] and mustard [6].
Add the shallot [7], grate the ginger [8] and add salt and pepper [9].
Blend all the ingredients until you get a homogeneous and rather compact mixture [10]. Place the dough in a bowl and add the breadcrumbs [11]. Now form the burgers: take a portion of dough and shape it [12].
You should obtain a flattened meatball [13]. Once formed, proceed with cooking: heat a burner on the stove, and when it is hot, grill the burgers for a couple of minutes on both sides [14], until they detach and have their typical grill marks. Now take the buns and fill them with the chickpea burgers, fresh salad and some tomato slices [15]. You can top off your chickpea burgers with your favorite sauces.
