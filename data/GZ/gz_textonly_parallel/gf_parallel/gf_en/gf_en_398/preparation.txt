To prepare the glazed BBQ ribs, start by stirring all the spices for the meat together and sprinkling around half onto one side [1]. Rub to thoroughly coat the meat [2]. Turn the cut around, sprinkle the rest over the meat and rub in once more [3].
Place the meat cut on a tray, cover with plastic wrap [4] and leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least two hours. In the meantime, prepare the BBQ sauce: finely chop the onion [5] and the garlic [6].
Place both in a saucepan with a little oil [7]. Stir frequently as they brown. Now you can add the brown sugar [8], the sweet and hot paprika [9], stirring all the while.
Add the Worchester sauce [10], the vinegar [11] and the mustard [12].
Add the black pepper [13], the maple syrup [14] and last of all, the ketchup [15].
Season with just a little salt [16] and cook the sauce for around 5 minutes, so that it acquires flavor and consistency. Remove from the heat and blend with an immersion blender [17]. Take the meat and remove the plastic wrap [18].
Cover with the aluminum foil [19] and bake the ribs in a static oven preheated to 400?F for around 1 and a half hours [20]. Once the 90 minutes are up, remove the aluminum foil and continue to bake for another 30 minutes, to slightly reduce the liquids [21]. 
Only 30 minutes of cooking time left now, but this time part of the glaze needs to be brushed onto the surface of the ribs [22]. The process is very simple: every 5 minutes, remove the tray [23] and brush some of the sauce over the surface, which will become increasingly caramelized each time [24].
Continue in this way [25] until you finish the sauce and the cooking time is over [26]. Now your glazed BBQ ribs are ready, serve them with a little sauce on the side, if there is any left over [27].
