This crumb cake is a tasty treat made with a shortcrust pastry base that isn’t rolled out, but crumbled and spread over the dish, giving this dessert its name. A wide arrange of delicious fillings to suit all tastes can be sandwiched between the base and the crumbly top layer. We’ve already tempted you with Nutella and the one with a sweet and creamy apple filling, and today we aim to surprise you even more. Cappuccino and chocolate crumble is an even more irresistible variation on the theme: Creamed ricotta and mascarpone mixed with coffee and chunks of dark chocolate come together to create a rich and delicious dessert, perfect as a snack but also as a special treat!
