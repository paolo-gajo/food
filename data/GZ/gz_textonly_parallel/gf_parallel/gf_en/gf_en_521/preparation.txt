To prepare the cappuccino and chocolate crumble, brew up some espresso coffee in your Italian moka pot and let it cool. Then cut the cold butter into pieces and place it in a bowl. Add the sugar [1], eggs [2], sifted flour [3],
and baking powder (also sifted) [4]. Knead quickly with your fingertips [5] to obtain a crumbly mixture [6].
Add just over half the mixture to a buttered, floured 9-inch (24 cm) [7]springform cake pan.  Save the rest for later. Spread the mixture over the entire surface, right up to the edges [8]. Now make the creamy filling. Add the ricotta and mascarpone [9] to a bowl,
then add the powdered sugar [10] and whisk until the mixture is smooth [11]. Pour the cold coffee into the milk [12] and mix.
Add the milky coffee to the ricotta and mascarpone mixture [13], whisking to combine [14]. The resulting mixture should be smooth and uniform [15]. 
Lastly, add the coarsely chopped chocolate [16] and mix with a spatula [17]. The cream is ready; pour it into the mold and level with a spatula [18].
Cover with the remaining crumble mixture [19], spreading it over the entire surface to cover the creamy filling and extend slightly up the edges [20]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (175°C) for approximately 50 minutes. When it is golden brown, take it out of the oven [21] and let it cool completely. 
At this point, remove the pan [22], transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar [23], and serve [24].
