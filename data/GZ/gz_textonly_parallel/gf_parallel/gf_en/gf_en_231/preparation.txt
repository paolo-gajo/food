When making pizza muffins, your first job is to take care of the dough [1]: Combine flour, baking powder, and salt [2], then slowly add the water and mix with your hands [3].
Always knead by hand [4] and when all the water is absorbed, transfer the dough to a pastry board and roll it into a ball [5]. Your next job is the filling: Cut the mozzarella into cubes [6], 
then pour the tomato passata into a bowl and season with oil [7], salt [8], and oregano [9]. Stir to combine the flavors.
Go back to your ball of dough, sprinkle a little flour over the work surface and roll out into a slightly oval shape [10] with a rolling pin. Your aim is to achieve a thickness of approximately ½ inch (1 cm) [11]. Begin to spread the tomato passata over the surface of the dough with a spoon [12], adding approximately 2 tablespoons to each side.
Once you have added all the topping, fold the pastry over starting from the side closest to you [13] and roll it up (14-15).
Transfer the roll to a chopping board and cut 12 mini rolls using a large, very sharp knife. (16-17). Grease a mold for 12 muffins [18]. 
Place the rolls in the molds with the cut side uppermost [19]. Add a little tomato passata that you have set aside [20] and stuff 3 cubes of mozzarella for pizza [21] into the middle of each muffin.
The pizza muffins are ready for cooking [22]: bake them in a preheated conventional oven at 350°F (180°C) for 20/25 minutes. Once ready, take them out of the oven, wait for a few moments before tipping them out of the mold, and season with a little oregano to taste [23]. Enjoy your pizza muffins while they are still piping hot [24].
