To prepare pasta with eggplant pesto, start by cooking the eggplants: wash and dry them, place them on an oven tray lined with parchment paper [1], pierce them with the prongs of a fork and bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 428°F (220°C), for 45-50 minutes. Once the eggplants are done, remove the baking tray from the oven and leave to cool [2]. In the meantime, bring a saucepan full of salted water to the boil, you'll need it for cooking the pasta. Tip the eggplants and cut them in half [3],
then remove the pulp using a spoon [4]. Place the pulp in a fine mesh colander over a bowl and press down with the back of a spoon or a fork [5] to remove the excess water [6].
By now you will have brought the water in the pan to the boil, so cook the bavette pasta [7] and in the meantime, continue preparing the eggplant pesto. Place the eggplant pulp in a bladed mixer and add the peeled almonds [8], the grated grana cheese [9],
the grated lemon peel [10] and the extra virgin olive oil [11]. Add salt and pepper to taste, blend for a short burst to obtain a dense and rather creamy puree [12].
Coarsely chop the mint with a knife [13], then place the eggplant pesto in a large pan (away from the heat), add a ladle of pasta cooking water [14] and the coarsely chopped mint leaves [15].
Drain the pasta when firm to the bite and place it straight in the pan with the eggplant pesto [16]. Remove from the stove and stir the pasta thoroughly together with the sauce, add a little more pasta cooking water if necessary [17]. Your pasta with eggplant pesto is ready to be served, hot or at room temperature [18]!
