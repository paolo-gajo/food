Today we're showcasing eggplant in this tasty and genuine first course laden with summer aromas: pasta with eggplant pesto! Pesto is a creative way of making the most of seasonal vegetables: unlike the genoese version, eggplant pulp is enriched with almond, grana cheese, lemon peel and mint, which perfectly balance the savory flavors, aroma and freshness in this condiment! The result is an enveloping and creamy pesto, perfect served with long pasta shapes, like bavette. Prepare pasta with eggplant pesto for a summer lunch and if the heat is especially unforgiving, try serving it at room temperature: you will feel the flavors even more and all your guests will ask for seconds!
