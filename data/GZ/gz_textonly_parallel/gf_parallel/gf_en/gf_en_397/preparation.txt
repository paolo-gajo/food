To prepare gnocchi alla romana, place the milk in a pan over the heat, and add a knob of butter (about 2 tbsp (30 g) of the total amount), salt [2], and a pinch of nutmeg [2]; as soon as the milk starts to boil, whisk in the semolina [3], stirring vigorously to prevent the formation of lumps.
Cook the mixture over low heat for a few minutes, until it has thickened [4]; remove the pan from the heat and add the two yolks [5] to the mixture, stirring this time with a wooden spoon [6].
Add the Parmesan cheese [7] and stir again [8]. Now pour half of the dough, still hot, on a sheet of baking paper [9].
and using your hands, give it a cylindrical shape [10]. To avoid scalding your hands, first put them under cold running water. Once you have obtained a uniform cylinder, wrap it in baking paper [11]. Do the same with the other half of the dough you had put aside. Place the two rolls [12] in the refrigerator for about twenty minutes.
Once cooled, you will have a compact dough that you can easily slice with a knife [13]. To make cutting easier, we recommend wetting the blade with water. Once you have obtained about 40 pieces, place them on a previously buttered baking tray [14] and sprinkle them with melted, not hot, butter (about 5 tbsp) (70 g) [15].
Sprinkle the surface with Pecorino Romano [16] and bake in a static preheated oven at 400째 F (200째 C) for 20-25 minutes (if you use a convection oven, 350째 F, 180째 C, for 15 minutes). Now turn on the grill and gratin the top for 4-5 minutes. Once ready [17] serve your gnocchi alla romana hot [18]!
