People from Rome say: Thursday gnocchi, Friday fish and Saturday tripe! Gnocchi are an ancient first course, prepared with the most varied types of flour. They can be found in different shapes in many world cuisines. As Roman tradition dictates, these represent the classic Thursday dish, probably placed in the middle of the week to compensate for the lightness of the next day's meal... an arcane custom that is still observed today by the most nostalgic of Roman citizens. Today we have chosen a typical recipe from Lazio: gnocchi alla romana! Succulent semolina discs characterized by a golden crust, made fragrant by the addition of butter and pecorino cheese! Of course, in Rome, the right day to prepare them is Thursday, but once you try them, you will fall so in love with them that every day will be the right day to bring these gnocchi alla romana to the table! The secret? Serve them smoking hot to find out!
