Fragrant cookies to be enjoyed alone or dipped in fortified wine: however you want to eat them, wine cookies will surprise you for their simplicity and sweetness. They are made only with flour, oil, wine and sugar: they are aromatic due to the presence of anise, and fragrant thanks to the mixture of oil and white wine. One pulls the other at any time of the day... and night! They are also perfect, like tozzetti or cantucci (almond cookies), to serve to guests after dinner with coffee.Â
