To prepare the wine cookies, start by placing the anise seeds in the white wine, stir [1] and set aside. Pour the sifted flour with the baking powder [2], a pinch of salt, and sugar [3] into a bowl.
Mix by hand and then create a basin, where you can pour the oil [4] and wine with the anise seeds [5]. Knead with your hands. [6]
Move to a work surface once you have collected all the ingredients. Compact the dough well [7] and then take off one piece at a time, about 1 oz (28 g) [8], work it between the palms of your hands and create a strand of about 8 inches (20 cm) long [9].
Roll it up by joining the ends, sticking them together well [10]. Now you can dip the cookie in sugar [11], on one side [12]. You'll should het about 40 cookies.
Arrange the cookies by hand on a sheet lined with baking paper, with the sugar part facing upwards [13]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 25 minutes. Then take your wine cookies out of the oven [14], let them cool and serve. [15]
