To make the no-bake yogurt cake, first butter [1] and line an 8-inch (20 cm) springform pan with baking paper [2], following our instructions: how to line a cake pan with baking paper. Melt the butter in the microwave or in a saucepan and let it cool, then set it aside. Meanwhile, pour the biscuits into the mixer [3],
then blend them until they become a powder [4]. Transfer the blended biscuits into a bowl, then add the brown sugar [5] and melted butter [6].
Mix with a spatula to obtain a pasty mixture [7], and transfer it to a pan [8]; press it well on the bottom with the back of a spoon to make the base [9]. Put the base in the fridge and let harden for at least 30 minutes.
Now place the gelatin sheets in a large bowl filled with cold water, and let them soften for about 10 minutes [10]. In the meantime, heat the milk in a small saucepan (it should only nearly come to a boil). Once the gelatin is soft, squeeze it and pour it into the hot milk over low heat [11]. Mix with a whisk to carefully melt the gelatin [12]. Set aside for a moment and let the mixture cool.
Pour the fresh liquid cream into the bowl of the stand mixer with a whip, add the powdered sugar [13]Â  and whip until frothy [14]. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can also use a handheld mixer to whip the cream. Pour the yogurt into a bowl, then add the milk in which you have melted the gelatin, which will have cooled in the meantime [15].
Stir with a spatula to mix [16] then add the cream that you have previously whipped [17], start with a spoonful of cream to dilute the mixture, stirring vigorously, then add the remaining cream by stirring gently from the bottom to the top [18].
Pour the cream obtained into the mold [19] with the base that will have hardened in the meantime, level the surface with a spatula [20] and put back in the fridge to harden for at least 5 hours. Once the no-bake yogurt cake is ready, garnish it with berries as desired and serve [21].
