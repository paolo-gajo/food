No New Year’s dinner is complete without cotechino and lentils! There are those who eat it because they are superstitious, those who do it out of tradition, and those who simply appreciate its timeless taste! For this reason, we have experimented with many delicious variations of recipes with cotechino (pork sausage) in a pastry crust. Three layers with different consistencies to be discovered at the first cut: on the outside a crunchy puff pastry, followed by a velvety lentil cream that tastefully envelops the last layer, the soft heart of cotechino. Have fun decorating your cotechino in a crust with Christmas motifs, and it will create for sure a festive atmosphere at your table!
