To make the baked potatoes, wash and peel the potatoes [1] with a vegetable peeler, divide them in half and then into quarters [2], then cut them into small cubes [3].
Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot and then boil the potato cubes for 5 minutes [4], after this time drain the potatoes with a skimmer [5] and transfer them to a bowl. Flavor with fresh thyme leaves [6], 
 
season with the extra virgin olive oil [7], add salt and stir with a spoon [8]. Preheat a ventilated oven to 400° F (200° C) heating up the empty baking pan inside that will be used for cooking the potatoes. When the oven has reached the desired temperature, remove the baking pan using oven mitts to avoid burning yourself and drizzle oil on the bottom of the pan.
 
Add the potatoes, rosemary sprigs [10] and two whole cloves of garlic without peeling them [11]. Bake the potatoes at 400° F (200° C) for 1 hour or until the potatoes are crispy and golden. At least every 20 minutes, gently mix the potatoes to ensure even cooking. Once cooked, take your baked potatoes out of the oven [12], remove the garlic cloves, let the potatoes cool and then bring them to the table immediately!
