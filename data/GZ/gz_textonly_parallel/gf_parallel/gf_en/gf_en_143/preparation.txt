To make this seafood salad, start by cleaning the clams: Discard any whose shell is broken or open, placing the rest in a bowl and covering them with water [1]. Add a handful of coarse salt [2], stir gently [3], and leave to soak for a couple of hours, changing the water every so often.
In the meantime, cook the octopus: Chop the celery and carrots roughly [4] and add them to a pot filled with plenty of water, together with the parsley [5] and bay leaves [6].
Add the peppercorns [7] as well and bring to a boil. Dip the octopus’ tentacles in the boiling water 4-5 times [8] to get them to curl [9].
Then immerse the entire octopus in the water, cover the pot with a lid [10], and leave it to cook for 30-35 minutes over medium heat, skimming off any residue that forms on the surface of the water from time to time. Meanwhile, clean the mussels: Remove the beard by pulling firmly with your hand [11], and any incrustations and barnacles using the blade of a knife. Then rinse under running water, scrubbing the shells well with steel wool [12].
Put the mussels aside and turn to cleaning the shrimp: Remove the head, legs [13], and tail, then remove the shell [14] and pull out the intestine gently [15].
Now clean the squid: Separate the head from the body and remove the cuttlebone [16], then remove the fins and skin [17]. Then cut into rings [18].
At this point, check on the octopus: Prick it in the middle with a fork and when it’s ready, it will be tender but still firm [19]. Transfer the cooked octopus to a colander and let it cool, then remove the vegetables from the cooking water [20] and add the squid. Boil for around 4-5 minutes, depending on the size [21].
 
Pour in the shrimp [22], too, and blanch for 30 seconds, then drain the squid and shrimp and set aside. Once the clam soaking has passed, drain them [23] and tap them one by one on a cutting board to make sure there’s not any leftover sand [24]. If there is, you will need to discard the clams that still have sand in them.
Add a drizzle of oil to a pot and brown a clove of garlic in it. Then add the mussels [25] and clams [26] and cover the pot with a lid [27].
Cook over high heat for 5 minutes, just enough time for them to open [28]. Drain the cooking liquid into a bowl – you can use it in other recipes. Discard any mussels and clams that are still closed and remove the open ones from their shells and place in a bowl; be sure to keep a few in the shells to use as garnish [29]. Take the octopus, which should have cooled by now, and clean it, first cutting across the head at eye level to remove them [30].
 
Remove the insides from the head [31] and the beak on the underside, in the middle of the tentacles [32]. Cut the tentacles into ¾-inch (2-cm) pieces [33] and place in a large bowl.
 
Lastly, prepare the citronette dressing: Place the oil and lemon juice in a small bowl, then chop the parsley [34] and add it to the bowl as well [35]. Season with salt and pepper and emulsify with a fork [36].
Take the bowl with the octopus and add the shelled mussels and clams [37], squid [38], and shrimp [39].
 
Dress with the citronette emulsion [40] and stir well [41]. Garnish with the whole mussels and clams you set aside, and then serve up your delicious seafood salad [42]!
