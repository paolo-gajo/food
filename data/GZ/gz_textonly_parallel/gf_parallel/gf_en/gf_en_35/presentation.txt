Vegetable pie is the ideal dish to make for a picnic or lunch with friends. The version we present you with here is simple and quick to make, but delicious too, because it is made with a puff pastry base, a bechamel enriched with egg and cheese, and crisp vegetables cut into ribbons and glazed with extra virgin olive oil. The concentric circle decoration makes the vegetable pie an original and highly presentable recipe!
