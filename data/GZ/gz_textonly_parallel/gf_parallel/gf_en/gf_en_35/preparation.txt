To prepare the vegetable pie, start with the bechamel: heat the milk with a pinch of nutmeg in a saucepan [1] and bring to the boil. In the meantime, prepare the butter and flour roux in another saucepan: melt the butter and add the sieved flour and salt [2]. Stir for the roux to thicken [3]
and add the milk to the roux [4], stirring all the while until the bechamel thickens correctly [5]. When ready, leave it to cook at room temperature; in the meantime, beat the eggs and add the parmesan cheese [6].
Add this mixture to the bechamel and amalgamate thoroughly [7]. Now prepare the base for the vegetable pie: roll the puff pastry out using a rolling pin according to the shape of the baking tray you'll use; place it inside a previously buttered 9 inch baking tray that is 2 inches tall [8] and if necessary, cut away any excess pastry around the edge [9].
Now prepare the vegetables: wash the zucchini and peel the carrots, then use a mandolin to thinly slice them lengthwise, creating ribbon strips (10-11). Pour the bechamel and egg mixture onto the pie base [12]
and start decorating the pie with the vegetable ribbons: carefully arrange them vertically, to create a concentric decoration covering the entire surface (13-14). Now dab some oil onto the pie [15] and add a little salt. Bake in the oven for around 50/60 minutes at 355°F (180°C), and your vegetable pie is ready!
