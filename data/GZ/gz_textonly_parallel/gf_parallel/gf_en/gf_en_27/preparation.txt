To make watermelon pizza, start with the cream: peel a ripe mango [1] and cut into slices around the pit [2]. Now dice it [3];
place the pulp in the mixer bowl [3] and blend until smooth [5]. Place the spreadable cheese in a bowl and sweeten with the honey [6];
thoroughly mix the ingredients together [7], then add the blended mango pulp and continue stirring with a spatula [8] to obtain a homogeneous mix [9].
Place the watermelon on a cutting board and cut a slice that is 0.8 inches thick [10], then into 8 wedges [11]; now add the cream [12].
Spread it evenly over the entire surface [13] and decorate with the wild berries and edible flowers; be sure to distribute them evenly over each wedge [14]. Grate some lime zest for an extra touch of freshness. Once garnished, delicately separate the slices and serve your fresh watermelon pizza right away [15]!
