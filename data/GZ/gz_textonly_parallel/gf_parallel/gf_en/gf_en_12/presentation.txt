A quick batter, zucchini slices, a little oil for frying and hey presto, zucchini fritters are served! We have a trick up our sleeve to make them even more special. Zucchini and pecorino cheese clouds are a brand new treat in store for you. These fritters are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, with aÂ texture that truly makes them as light as a cloud. How can this be? Thanks to a frothy batter that is whipped until stiff, and the addition of a pinch of instant yeast. The fritters will rise during cooking and turn into what can only be described as clouds! The addition of pecorino cheese, with its intense and persistent character, is a match made in heaven with the sweeter flavor of the zucchini, for an irresistible taste experience! Serve as a starter to guests to tantalize their taste buds in a flavorsome and original way.
