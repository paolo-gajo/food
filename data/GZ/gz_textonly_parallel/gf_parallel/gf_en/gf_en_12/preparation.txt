To prepare zucchini and pecorino cheese clouds, start by preparing the zucchini: wash and tip them [1], then cut into slices of around 8 mm [2]. Heat the oil and in the mean time separate the yolks from the eggs whites [3].?
Use a whisk [4] to beat the egg whites until firm [5]. Then beat the yolks with the same whisk for a few minutes [6].
Gradually add the milk [7], then the flour [8] and the yeast [9], stirring with the whisk all the while.?
Remove the whisk and add the pecorino cheese [10]. Stir [11] and then add the thyme leaves [12].
Flavor with salt and pepper [13] and stir once more before adding the zucchini slices [14].?Now gradually add the egg whites [15].
Delicately stir them in with a turner [16] to avoid deflating the egg whites [17]. By now the oil will have reached a temperature of 170?: fry the clouds by immersing a few pieces at a time [18].
They will cook in around 3-4 minutes [19]; turn them over half way into the cooking time and drain them on some absorbent paper [20]. Proceed in this way to obtain around forty pieces. Serve your zucchini and pecorino cheese clouds while they are still nice and hot [21].
