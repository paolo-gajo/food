Fritters usually elicit mixed reactions, revealing a love/hate relationship... some people like to bake them in the oven as we did with the sweet version, some can only imagine them fried, and some eat them but don’t want anything to do with making them! Today, don’t think twice and get ready to fry, because these zucchini fritters served warm and freshly made are a treat for all of the senses: These flavorful, fragrant bites are crispy on the outside and melty on the inside, tempting you at first sight and winning you over with the first bite. Zucchini fritters are perfect for whetting your appetite as an appetizer or for jazzing up a buffet, maybe together with some tasty caper fritters, which will help to well and truly banish any feelings of guilt! As we were saying at the beginning, fritters are something you either love or hate... In this case, we’re sure you’ll love them! And if you’re looking for other ways to cook zucchini, try it in batter too.
