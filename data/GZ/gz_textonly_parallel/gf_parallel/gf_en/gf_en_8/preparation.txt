To make the zucchni fritters, first wash and dry the zucchini thoroughly, then trim [1] and grate using a large-hole grater [2]. Place the grated zucchini in a strainer and leave to drain for around 30 minutes [3] so they lose their vegetable water. You can also press using a spoon if necessary, or else press the zucchini well in a cloth to squeeze out more liquid.
Add the sifted flour and dried brewer’s yeast [4] to a large bowl, and then begin to stir with a wooden spoon. Next, pour in the water, stirring vigorously [5] to keep lumps from forming. Add fine salt to taste: We recommend 1½ tsp but use as much or as little as you like or are used to [6].
Pour in the grated cheese [7], continuing to stir vigorously; at this point, the dough will have a fairly dense [8] consistency. Finally, add the well-drained grated zucchini [9] 
and stir until the dough is well blended [10]. Then, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise for 3 hours at a temperature of around 79°-80°F (26°-27°C), for example in an oven that’s turned off but with the light on. After 3 hours, the dough will have risen and will have little bubbles [11]. Next, heat the peanut oil in a saucepan, and once it’s reached a temperature of 338°F (170°C) (measured using a food thermometer), submerge a spoonful of dough into the hot oil, using another spoon to get it to slide off [12].
Fry a few fritters at a time to keep the oil temperature from cooling down. Fry for 3-4 minutes, turning the fritters with a slotted spoon so they cook evenly on both sides [13]. With this amount of dough, you’ll get around 26 fritters. Once they’re nice and golden, drain the fritters with a slotted spoon [14] and transfer them on a paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Blot them to remove any additional excess oil [15]. Add more salt if needed and serve your zucchini fritters piping hot!
