Stuffed vegetables are an excellent solution: transform them into a unique and tasty dish that is suitable for any occasion. There are many ways to prepare stuffed vegetables, choosing from the qualities that best lend themselves to this type of recipe, such as onions, zucchini flowers or peppers. Sometimes these dishes are part of regional tradition, as in the case of Ligurian-style stuffed zucchini. There are several variations of this recipe, which often changes depending on the area or even from family to family, perhaps opting for ground meat, ricotta or mortadella. We instead propose a very tasty version with a filling made of tuna, anchovies, and eggs enriched by the aroma of pepper and thyme. Stuffed zucchini are the typical example of how simple ingredients can lend themselves to both a main course as well as a tasty appetizer. And if you love Ligurian products, you can make delicious fritters or a quiche with a delicate flavor, made with a special local vegetable, the crookneck summer squash!
