To prepare casarecce with musky octopus and eggplant, start by draining the eggplant. To do this, wash and trim before cutting into slices about ½ inch (1 cm) thick [1], and then into cubes [2]. Place a colander in a bowl, then pour in the eggplant cubes and sprinkle with coarse salt [3].
Cover with a plate [4] and place a weight on it, such as a container of dried pulses or ceramic balls [5]. This process rids the eggplants of their bitter juices. It will take about an hour and then you’ll be able to see how much dark water [6] has drained into the bowl.
Meanwhile, prepare the musky octopus: Separate the tentacles from the heads [7], slice the heads open [8] and cut into strips [9], 
then separate the tentacles [10] from one another and set aside. Peel the shallot [11] and chop finely [12].
Lastly, chop the fresh chili pepper after removing the stalk [13]. In a frying pan, brown the shallot and chili in the extra virgin olive oil. Once hot, add the sliced musky octopus [14]. After a few moments of cooking over high heat, you’ll notice that the octopus will start to take on color; now add white wine [15] and allow to simmer so the alcohol evaporates.
In the meantime, wash the cherry tomatoes, remove the stalks, and cut into four pieces [16]. As soon as the alcohol has evaporated from the sauce, add the tomatoes to the sauce, season with salt to taste [17], then cover and cook over medium heat for 15-20 minutes [18].
Once the eggplant has been draining for an hour or so, rinse quickly under running water [19], then place the cubes on a clean dishcloth [20] and pat dry to remove excess water [21].
Pour the vegetable oil for frying into a narrow pot suitable for deep frying. Once it’s hot, add the eggplant cubes and cook for a few minutes [22]. As soon as the eggplant is cooked, take the cubes out with a slotted spoon [23] and let them drain a little into a colander. Then taste and add salt if necessary [24].
Cook the pasta in plenty of salted boiling water [25]. Meanwhile, wash the parsley, dry, and chop with a knife [26] before setting aside. As soon as the pasta is cooked, drain it using a slotted spoon and leave it to warm in the pan for a few moments together with the musky octopus sauce [27].
Add the eggplant [28] and chopped parsley, mix everything together well [29] and finally serve the casarecce pasta with musky octopus and eggplant while still piping hot [30]!
