To prepare pandoro tree, start from the diplomat cream: first of all, prepare the pastry cream, by heating the milk in a saucepan with half a vanilla bean and its seeds [1]. Beat the egg yolk and sugar together in a bowl [2], then add the cornstarch [3]; as an alternative you can replace it with the same amount of rice starch, or potato starch.
Remove the bean with some pincers and gradually add the heated milk to the mixture [4], stirring with the whisk. Place the mixture back on the stove and stir continuously until the cream thickens [5]. Place the pastry cream in a bowl and leave it to cool thoroughly at room temperature and then in the refrigerator; place a sheet of plastic wrap over the surface to cover it [6].
Prepare the cream: place the thoroughly chilled liquid milk in the planetary mixer bowl [7] with whisks, or use an electric whisk to beat it; when the cream becomes full-bodied in consistency, add the sieved powdered sugar [8] and amalgamate with the cream, stirring with a spatula [9].
Once the pastry cream fully cools, gradually add the chantilly cream [10] and temper both creams with a whisk [11] to obtain a frothy, smooth and homogeneous mass [12]. Place the cream in a star-tipped pastry bag.
Take the sliced pandoro and cut it into horizontal slices, each around 0.8 inches (2 cm) thick (13-14). Now take a serving dish, place the base slice on it, add some of the diplomat cream you prepared earlier to the middle [15],
then continue with the next slice: place it on top, rotated so that all the tips of the slice beneath are visible. Now add some more cream [16] and continue adding slices and layers of cream to recreate the pandoro [17]. Decorate the protruding tips with tufts of cream [18]
and then garnish with currants and blueberries, by adding them to the tufts of cream and sprinkling them over the surface (19-20). If you like, complete the dessert with a sprinkling of powdered sugar before serving the pandoro tree [21]!
