To prepare the yogurt briquette with berries, start by making the coulis. Start by hulling and chopping the strawberries into pieces [1]. Place the blueberries and the raspberries in a saucepan [2] and add the strawberries [3].
Now add the sugar and the water too [4]. Leave to cook [5] for around 6 minutes, until nice and dense [6].
Now place the yogurt in a bowl, add the seeds of a vanilla bean, the honey [7], and stir [8]. Soak the gelatin in cold water for around 5 minutes. In the meantime bring 1.8 oz of milk to the boil [9].
Remove from the heat, wait 1 minute, then delicately wring out the isinglass and add it to the milk [10]; stir with a spoon until fully dissolved ; when lukewarm [11], add it to the yogurt mixture [12]
and stir thoroughly with a spatula [13]. Beat the other 8.8 oz of fresh milk together with the powdered sugar (use a thoroughly cleaned whisk) [14] and gradually add to the yogurt mix a little at a time, stirring from the bottom up [15].
As soon as you have incorporated all the milk [16], place half of the mixture in a 8x4.5 inch sponge cake mold [17], add some of the coulis in the middle, leaving a space around the edge [18].
Cover with the remaining cream [19] and smooth the surface [20]. Now coarsely crumble the cookies by hand [21]
and cover the base of your briquette [22]. Lightly press down by hand so that they adhere thoroughly [23] and leave in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 3 hours. Place all the berries in a tall container [24]Â 
and blend with an immersion mixer [25]. Once the resting time is up, the briquette will be solid and compact. Run the blade of a knife along the edge of the mold so that it is easier to remove the dessert [26]. Place a serving dish over the mold and turn it over [27],
to remove the briquette from the mold [28]. Decorate with the berries, the coulis [29] and the mint leaves. Now serve it right away!
