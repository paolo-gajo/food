Yogurt briquette with berries is a fresh spoon dessert that catches everyone's attention thanks to its shape, while also winning everyone over with its delicateness. The fresh cream and greek yogurt mingle to create an irresistible cream, flavored with the seeds of a vanilla bean and honey. After pouring into the briquette mold, simply leave it to cool in the refrigerator and it will become very similar to a creamy semifreddo. The sweet flavor and dense consistency of the cream are exalted by the typical yet subtle sour flavor of the berries: strawberries, raspberries, blueberries are turned into a delicious coulis, in just a few steps. Not only do the strawberries, along with the blueberries and raspberries, enrich the briquette with flavor, thanks to their bright colors they also create a visual contrast with the immaculate white yogurt briquette. For a final touch to your dessert, garnish it with a few leaves of fresh mint and serve your yogurt briquette with berries once thoroughly chilled, for the most beautiful (and delicious) endings to your meal!
