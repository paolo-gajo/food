Place the flour, water [1], egg [2] and oil in a bowl [3].
Add the salt [4] and mix the ingredients together with a fork [5]. Now knead the mixture with your hands [6].
Once homogeneous, place it on a worktop and knead to obtain a soft, smooth and elastic dough [7]. Shape it into a ball [8], cover with plastic wrap or a bowl, and leave to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the filling: melt the butter and leave to one side, then peel the peaches [9].
Cut away the pulp and remove the pit [10]. Cut the peach pulp into pieces that are around 1.2 inches in size [11] and place them in a large bowl. Add the brown sugar to the peaches [12].
Add the breadcrumbs too [13], and the melted butter, once cooled [14]. Stir thoroughly [15].
Add the vanilla [16], the grated zest of a lemon [17] and the pecan nuts [18].
Stir thoroughly [19] and leave to one side. Melt the butter for brushing onto the strudel. Place a cloth on the worktop and sprinkle with a little flour. Place the strudel dough on the cloth and add a little more flour [20]. Now use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until around 0.2" thick [21].
Very delicately continue to spread the dough by hand, until you form a very thin, almost transparent rectangle [22].?Brush on some of the melted butter [23] and place the peach filling onto the left side of the rectangle [24], leaving a free space.
Now lift the dough to the left of the filling and fold it: try to cover as much as possible [25]. Now fold the side edges and pinch the dough together with your fingers [16]. Now roll the strudel, using the cloth [27].
Once you have rolled up the entire strudel [28], reopen the cloth, spread the last layer of dough over it [29] and thoroughly seal both ends [30].
Using the cloth, place the strudel on a tray lined with parchment paper [31]. Delicately pull out the cloth [32] and brush the remaining butter onto the entire surface [33].
Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 400°F (200°C) for 35 minutes. Remove from the oven [34] and leave to cool. Sprinkle with the icing sugar [35] and serve the peach strudel [36]!
