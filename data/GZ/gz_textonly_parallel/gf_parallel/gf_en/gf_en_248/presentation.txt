Together we're going to prepare peach strudel, an alternative to classic apple strudel, perfect for the hottest time of the year! The base dough remains the same and in accordance with tradition, must be delicately rolled out as thinly as possible, until almost transparent; this is the only way of making sure the dough will cook through to the innermost layer. For the filling we looked to seasonal fruits, opting for one of the sweetest ones. When we tried making it with peaches we were pleasantly surprised! We have enriched the strudel with pecan nuts and added breadcrumbs to absorb all the peach juice released during baking, to achieve the right degree of moistness. With fragrant lemon and vanilla, the peach strudel will liven up your outdoor evenings: remember to serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a truly superlative result!
