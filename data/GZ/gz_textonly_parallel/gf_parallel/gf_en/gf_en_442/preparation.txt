To prepare easy pistachio ice cream, start with the syrup: in a saucepan pour the sugar [1], water [2] and turn on the flame over low heat [3].
Meanwhile, pour both the milk and the cream into a jug [4]. As soon as the syrup has come to a boil [5], turn off the heat and let it cool. Pour the syrup into the milk and cream mixture [6]
and blend everything with an immersion blender [7]. Transfer in a silicone mold [8]. Transfer to the freezer and let it rest overnight [9].
At this point, remove the cubes from the mold [10] and transfer them to a food processor [11]. Blend everything until you get a creamy mixture [12],
add the pistachios [13] and blend again until you get a smooth cream [14]. Transfer to a container (preferably aluminum, ceramic or glass. Avoid plastic) [15] and transfer to the freezer for at least 6 hours. When it is time to serve it, take it out of the freezer 5-10 minutes before and work it with a spoon, scraping gradually until you are able to mix to bring it back to the creamy state.
