To make potato and ham pie, start by placing the potatoes in cold water and cooking them for 40 minutes once the water starts to boil; pierce with a fork to check they are nicely done [1]. In the meantime, wash and dry the fresh spinach and place it in a pan in which you previously browned a garlic clove in a drizzle of oil [2]. Cover with the lid and cook over medium flame for around 5 minutes, until it releases its water [3].
Place the cooked spinach in a colander over a bowl [4] and press down on them [5] to remove any excess liquid [6].
When the potatoes are ready, peel and mash them in a large bowl while still hot, using a potato masher [7]. Season with salt [8] and pepper, then add the grated Grana cheese [9].
Add the finely chopped rosemary too [10], and the egg yolks [11]. Stir into a homogeneous mixture [12].
Thinly slice the caciocavallo cheese [13]. Now Butter a 9" (23 cm) diameter mold and sprinkle with the grated Grana cheese [14], then add more than half of the potato mixture and smooth with the back of a spoon, so that it adheres to the base and sides [15].
Distribute the spinach over the potato base [16] then add half of the caciocavallo slices [17] and the cooked ham [18].
Add another layer of caciocavallo [19] and cover with the rest of the potato mixture [20]; press down by hand [21].
Brush a little oil over the surface [22] and bake in a static oven preheated to 375°F (190°C) for around 50 minutes. Once the baking time is up [23], remove the potato and ham pie and serve it hot or warm [24]!
