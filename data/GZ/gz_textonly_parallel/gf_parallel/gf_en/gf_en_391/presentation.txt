The unmissable star of Christmas spreads, gourmet panettone is the savory version of the traditional eponymous dessert, earning its place at the table as a traditional starter. The base dough is the same as for classic panettone, but without the addition of candied fruit and sultan raisins, resulting in a more neutral flavor. Once baked, the panettone is cut into discs, to make lots of soft layers ready to be filled, just like sandwiches. The filling is the personal touch that characterizes this preparation: sauces, salamis, salmon, cheeses and many other delicious ingredients to your taste, they will all make perfect fillings for your very own panettone. Alternate fillings to make different flavored layers, so that each time you cut the panettone into slices, each diner will be able to enjoy all the flavors in one go. Enrich the festive table with a rich and delicious starter that will whet the appetite of guests young and old. And, to really get your table into the festive spirit, you could even try making a beautiful bread wreathe!
