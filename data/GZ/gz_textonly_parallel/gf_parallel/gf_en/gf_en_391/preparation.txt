To make panettone start with the dough: place the sieved manitoba flour in a planetary mixer [1], along with the milk [2]; add the brewers yeast [3] and start to mix, to obtain a coarse dough that isn't too smooth.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap [4]. Leave the biga dough to rest in the refrigerator overnight (12 hours). The next morning, place the biga dough in the planetary mixer bowl with a hook. Add another 0.5 tsp of yeast [5], 0.5 cup of milk [6],
the malt [7], the sugar [8] and the sieved flour 0 [9].
Mix briefly, then add the egg [10] and salt. Continue mixing with the hook to obtain a smooth and elastic dough. Now add the slightly softened butter, one piece at a time [11], wait until the previous piece is absorbed before adding another. Wait to obtain a glossy and elastic dough that wraps around the hook [12].
Dab some butter onto a bowl with a brush [13] and place the dough inside, shaping it into a ball [14]. Cover with plastic wrap [15] and leaven inside the switched off oven, with the lights on, for around 4 hours.
Place the dough on a pastry board lightly sprinkled with flour [16] and spread it by pulling out the corners [17]. Fold it 3 ways (18-19)
and pull the short sides to lengthen it [20]. Start rolling the dough [21],
pressing down on the closure with your thumbs, gradually bringing the outer corners towards the middle [22]. Place the resulting ball in a 2.2 lb panettone mold [23]. Leaven for around 4 hours in the switched off oven with the lights on, until the dough rises up to the edge. Brush the surface with the egg white [24] and place in a static oven preheated to 338°F (170°C) for around 45 minutes (or in a ventilated oven at 302°F (150°C) for 35 minutes). In the lowest shelf of the oven. Check that it's done using the toothpick test, be sure to insert it right into the middle, and remove from the oven if the pick emerges dry.
Once baked, remove the panettone from the oven and skewer it towards the bottom using a special pin [25] (or knitting needles, or steel skewers) and leave it to cool upside down, weighing down both ends [26], without touching the cap (to maintain the dome shape and prevent it from deflating). The panettone is ready [27]; before filling it, leave it in the refrigerator so that it becomes firmer.
