To prepare oven baked rice, start by dicing the fiordilatte mozzarella into 0.21 inch cubes approximately [1] and leave 2 or 3 slices for the final decoration. Place the cubes in a colander [2] and leave to one side for at least an hour, to drain the excess whey. Prepare the sauce in the meantime. Peel and finely chop the onion [3].
Add a drizzle of oil to the saucepan, followed by the onion [4]; stir and sweat on a low flame for around 5 minutes. Soften the onion and then add the tomato puree [5]; pour a little water to the emptied bottle to clean it and dilute the sauce. Add salt to taste [6] and leave to cook for at least 40 minutes.
Once the indicated cooking time is up, dilute the sauce with a little hot water if necessary, bring to the boil and add the rice [7]. Cook for the length of time indicated on the packet (usually around 18 minutes) and stir frequently so that it does not stick to the pan. Remove from the heat 2-3 minutes before the end of the cooking time [8], add 2/3 of the diced fiordilatte cheese [9]
and 2/3 of the grated Parmigiano Reggiano [10], a few hand-torn basil leaves [11] and lastly, pepper to taste [12].
Stir thoroughly [13] and place in a baking tray. Smooth the surface and sprinkle with the remaining fiordilatte cheese, the grated Parmigiano Reggiano [14] and a few basil leaves. Bake in a static oven preheated to 430°F (220°C) for around 15-20 minutes; if you want a crust to form on the surface then switch the oven to grill mode and leave the rice inside a few minutes longer. When ready, leave the oven baked rice to rest for 5 minutes before serving [15].
