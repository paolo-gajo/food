Couscous: the name alone is enough to whisk us away to the magical world of North African cuisine, made up of fragrant spices, intense aromas, and strong flavors. The culinary tradition of these little golden grains traveled from North Africa to reach the coasts of Sicily, going on to spread across the European continent. Today, we have a Mediterranean version of this flavorful dish: vegetable couscous. A pan full of fresh, colorful vegetables meets couscous, this amazing ingredient with a history stretching back thousands of years, in a union of flavors and aromas that combines traditions and cultures. You can decide whether to eat this couscous while itâ€™s still warm and serve it in a tagine for a dinner full of amazing flavor, or else cold as a snack on the beach under your umbrella. No matter how you decide to savor this summertime dish, you can accompany it with aromatic condiments such as the traditional harissa: It will be love at first bite!
