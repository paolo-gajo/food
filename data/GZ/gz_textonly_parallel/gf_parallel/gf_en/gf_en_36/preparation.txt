To make the vegetable couscous, start by cleaning and chopping the vegetables and spices needed for the recipe. Cut the chili into strips, removing the seeds inside [1]. Wash and peel the vegetables, then chop the spring onion roughly [2] and cut the eggplant first into slices, then into sticks, and finally into cubes [3].
Move on to the carrots: First cut them into slices on a slight diagonal, then into matchsticks [4]. Cut the zucchini in the same way [5]. Cut the snap peas into pieces, also making a slightly diagonal cut in this case [6].
 
Finally, cut the cherry tomatoes in half lengthwise [7]. Then heat a glug of oil [8] in a large, wok-style pan. Lightly fry the chili and the peeled whole garlic clove until they have seasoned the oil with their flavors, then add the eggplant [9], 
followed by the spring onion [10]. Let the eggplant really get seared, without adding more oil to keep it from getting too saturated, then add the carrots [11] and, a few minutes later, the snap peas [12]
and zucchini [13]. Season with salt [14] and pepper [15] to taste.
As the vegetables sauté, turn the heat up to high (just a few minutes will be enough), then remove the garlic [16] and add in the cherry tomatoes [17]. Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes, then turn off the heat: Your vegetables are ready. For the finishing touch, grate the ginger [18].
Stir in and mix well to combine, and then set the vegetable mixture aside [19]. Now turn to the couscous: We used pre-cooked couscous as it’s faster and easy to prepare. Pour it into a large bowl and season with the salt [20], the turmeric [21] (which will give the couscous its typical color as well as an extra hint of flavor),
and the oil [22], stir to combine [23], and pour the hot water [24] over everything.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap [25] and wait 2 minutes: After this time, the couscous is ready. Remove the plastic wrap, pour it out carefully onto a tray, and fluff using a fork [26]. Time to plate it up! Place some of the vegetables in the middle of each plate of couscous, adding a final touch with some mint leaves torn by hand [27]. The vegetable couscous is ready to go!
