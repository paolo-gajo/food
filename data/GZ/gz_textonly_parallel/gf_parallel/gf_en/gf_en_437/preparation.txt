 
To make the eggplant parmigiana, start with the sauce. Peel and chop the onion [1]. Add enough olive oil to a pot to cover the bottom and heat [2]. Then add the onion to the pot. Let it brown for a couple of minutes, stirring often so it doesn't burn, then add the tomato purée [3].
Season with salt and add the basil leaves [4]. Add a little water to the container the tomato purée was in to rinse it, pouring the water into the pot. Let this cook for 45-50 minutes over low heat [5]. In the meantime, cut the fiordilatte cheese into small cubes, setting aside one piece that you’ll use at the end [6].
Place the cheese cubes to drain in a colander positioned in a bowl [7], then cover with plastic wrap and set aside: This will allow the excess liquid to drain off [8]. Now, turn to the eggplant: Wash and trim them [9].
 
 
Cut them lengthwise into slices around 1/4 inch (4-5 mm) thick [10]. Once sliced, fry the eggplant in peanut oil that’s been heated to 340°F (170°C), immersing a few slices at a time [11]. As soon as they’ve turned slightly golden, drain on a tray lined with paper towel [12].
If you run out of space on the tray, place more paper towel [13] on top of the eggplant that are draining to create another layer with the newly fried eggplant [14]. Lastly, move on to the assembly: Start by adding some of the tomato sauce to a 9x13-inch (20x30-cm) baking dish [15]. 
 
Form the first layer by arranging the fried eggplant slices in the dish [16], then spooning over more sauce [17], spreading it evenly, and sprinkling in cubes of fiordilatte [18].
Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [19] and some basil leaves [20]. Start a new layer by adding more tomato sauce [21] and fried eggplant slices, which should be arranged facing opposite directions. 
Then add more cheese and basil leaves [22]. Repeat these steps until you reach the last layer of eggplant [23], again adding sauce and the fiordilatte that you set aside, torn into pieces by hand [24].
 
Finish off with grated Parmigiano cheese [25] and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for around 30 minutes [26]. When the eggplant parmigiana is finished baking, let it rest for 15-20 minutes before serving [27].
