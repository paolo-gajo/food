All you have to do is mention it to get an ovation at the table. The queen of single-course meals, the lifter of spirits: eggplant parmigiana. It’s a recipe shared by regions in both the north and south of Italy, all of which claim to be its birthplace: Emilia Romagna, Campania (parmigiana ’e mulignane), and Sicily (parmiciana or patrociane) with some variation in ingredients and ways of assembling it, but all absolutely fantastic! Have you ever wondered where this dish gets its name? The name “parmigiana” is said to come from the Sicilian “parmiciana,” which in dialect refers to the blinds made up of wooden slats stacked on one another: Just think about how the eggplant slices are arranged in the dish and you’ll see the similarity. With only a few ingredients, such as tomato, eggplant, basil, and cheese, you get a flavor-filled dish that’s a symbol of Mediterranean cuisine!
