To prepare the quick Colomba cake, first pour the manitoba flour and sugar [1] into a standard mixer bowl. Add the brewer's yeast [2], orange and lemon peel, and vanilla bean seeds [3].
Blend at low speed and slowly add the water [4]. Switch out the whisk with a hook and knead the dough for about 5 minutes. Then add the salt [5] and knead for a few more minutes until the dough is smooth. Transfer the dough to a flat surface and give it a spherical shape [6].
Place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap [7] and let it rest at room temperature for about 2 hours. After this time the dough will not have risen much. Transfer it back into a stand mixer bowl [8]. Add flour [9] and knead with the hook.
Pour in the beaten eggs one at a time [10], then the rum [11]. Add one small piece of butter at a time while kneading, waiting for each to be completely absorbed before adding the next [12]. This phase is very delicate and will take about 15 minutes.
At this point, add the cut candied fruit and drained raisins previously soaked in orange juice [13]. Knead a few more minutes until all the ingredients are well mixed [14]. Transfer the dough to a well-buttered work surface and fold with a dough scraper. With buttered hands, take the dough and place it in a bowl [15].
Cover with plastic wrap [16] and let rise for an hour and a half [17]. At this point, transfer the dough to a buttered surface [18],
then divide it into two equal parts [19] with the dough scraper. Spread one of the two portions, stretching it out with your hands, then roll it up into a cylinder [20]. Place it inside a paper Colomba cake mold so that it occupies the center of the mold to form the body [21].
Do the same thing with the second part of the dough and place it inside the mold so that it occupies the sides to form the wings [22]. At this point let it rise for 2 hours or until it is 2/3 inch (1.5 cm) from the top edge of the mold. Then you can start preparing the topping to cover the Colomba cake. Pour the hazelnuts, almonds [23] and brown sugar into a mixer [24].
Blend it all together [25], then transfer to a bowl, and add the cornstarch and fioretto corn flour [26]. Lastly, add the egg whites [27].
Whip until a homogeneous and creamy mixture is obtained [28]. Then pour it over the Colomba cake [29] and use a spatula to spread the topping over the entire surface [30].
Garnish with granulated sugar [31] and whole almonds [32]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 320° (160° C) for 50 minutes, then cover with aluminum foil and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Remove the cake and let it cool before serving [33].
