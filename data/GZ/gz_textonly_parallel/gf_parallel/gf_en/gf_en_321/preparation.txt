To prepare the no-bake tart, start from the base: melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat (1-2), then let it cool. Meanwhile, pour the cookies in a mixer [3]
and operate the blades until a crumbly compound is obtained [4]; pour the cookies in a bowl and then add the melted butter made to cool [5], stir until it is completely absorbed [6].
Then take a tart mold of 9.5" (23.5 cm) in diameter and with the removable disc (alternatively the hinged mold will work equally well) and start pouring the cookies base [7]: line the pan well on the edges before and on the bottom then [8]. Then place in the fridge to harden for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the gelatine leaves into a bowl with cold water and let them soak for at least 10 minutes.
In the meantime, pour the cream into a pan and heat over very low heat, until it just comes to a boil; pour the seeds of a vanilla bean scraped with the blade of a knife [10] and the open pod [11]. Add the sugar [12]
and mix with a whisk [13]. Once hot, turn off the heat, squeeze the gelatin sheets [14] and pour them into the hot cream [15],
stirring with a whisk to dissolve them completely [16]. Then pour the mixture into a bowl, also dropping the vanilla bean that will remain in the infusion [17], cover with plastic wrap [18]
and with the blade of a knife cut the film to create a vent in order to let the heat escape [19]; leave the mixture to cool to room temperature. Take the now firm base out of the fridge [20] and remove the vanilla pod from the cold panna cotta [21]. Mix everything
and transfer it to a jug to pour it more easily on the base [22], you will have to get almost to the brim of the tart. You can alternatively pour it slowly with a ladle. Place the tart in the refrigerator to harden for 3 hours, being very careful when moving it so that the liquid does not come out. Now prepare the fresh fruit: we washed and cut fresh strawberries, apricots, kiwis and a banana into chunks [23]. Once firm, resume the tart [24]
and garnish it with the pieces of fresh fruit [25] until it is completely covered [26]. The no-bake tart is ready to be served [27].
