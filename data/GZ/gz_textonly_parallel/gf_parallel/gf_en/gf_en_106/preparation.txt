To prepare the Spritz, start by pouring the ice into a wine glass and filling it to the brim [1]. Then pour the prosecco [2] followed by Aperol [3].
Finally a splash of soda water or very sparkling water [4]. Add a little more ice and stir gently [5]. Garnish with half a slice of orange and your Spritz is ready [6].
