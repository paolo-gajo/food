Who doesn't know of or hasn't had a Spritz? The Spritz, also known since 2011 as the Venetian Spritz by the IBA, the International Bartenders Association, is without a doubt one of the most popular aperitifs in Italy together with the Negroni and Americano. This cocktail has a deep-rooted history: it was created in Veneto, and from there it spread the ritual of the Italian-style aperitif first throughout the country, and then around the world. Its origins date back to 1800, when in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, troops of the Austrian Empire used to use a splash of sparkling water in local wines, as they were too alcoholic for them. It is precisely from spritzen, the German term describing this custom, that the name Spritz is derived! Did you know this story? Maybe what you don't know is how to prepare the original version at home. Here is the step-by-step recipe, perfect to share with friends for an aperitif, an informal meal or, why not, for brunch... make a Spritz with us!
