To prepare baked sea bass, start by cleaning the vegetables. Coarsely chop up the onion, the carrots and celery sticks [1], then cut the tomatoes in half and finely chop the parsley [2]. Place the vegetables in a baking tray, grease and add salt and pepper to taste [3].
Bake the vegetables in a static oven preheated to 350°F for around 10 minutes [4]. Clean the sea bass in the meantime. After skinning and gutting the fish, by running the blade of the knife down towards the head [5], remove all the fins: back, side and ventral ones [6].
Place a pinch of salt and a bay leaf in the middle [7], then arrange the sea bass on an oven tray, grease the surface of the fish and bake for 15 minutes in the oven [9]. Once ready, flavor with a few basil leaves and your baked sea bass is ready to be served [9].
