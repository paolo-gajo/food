To make spaghetti alla puttanesca, first rinse the capers under running water to remove the excess salt [1], then dry them and chop them roughly with a knife [2]. Take the pitted Gaeta olives and crush them by pushing down with the blade of a knife [3].
Wash, dry, and chop the parsley [4]. Bring a pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta, salting it to taste once boiling. In the meantime, add the oil, whole peeled garlic cloves, chopped dried chili [5], and anchovies [6] to a large frying pan.
Then add the rinsed capers [7]. Brown over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring often, so the anchovies dissolve and release all their aromas. Next, mash the peeled tomatoes slightly [8] and add them to the pan. Stir with a spoon and cook for another 10 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti until it’s al dente [9].
Once the sauce has cooked, remove the garlic cloves [10] and add the crushed olives [11]. Season the sauce with the chopped parsley [12].
When the pasta is al dente, drain it and pour directly into the pan [13], flipping it in the pan for 30 seconds, just enough time to allow all the flavors to meld together [14]. Your spaghetti alla puttanesca is ready to serve piping hot [15]!
