Mascarpone cream is a staple of confectionery, known most famously as the base for tiramisu or, during the holiday season, as an accompaniment for pandoro or panettone! Thanks to its subtle flavor and silky consistency, however, it can also serve as a delectable dessert in its own right. If you’re concerned about the presence of raw eggs, have no fear: In this recipe, we explain how to make pâte à bombe to pasteurize the eggs, or, alternatively, you can go straight for the eggless version. For an even more authentic version, though, why not try it with homemade mascarpone? Once ready, you’ll be able to use the mascarpone cream to make your favorite desserts or savor it on its own, served in a glass garnished with langue de chat cookies, berries, or just a sprinkling of unsweetened cocoa!
