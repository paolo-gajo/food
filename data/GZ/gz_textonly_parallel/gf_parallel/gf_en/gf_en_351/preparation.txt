 
To make the mascarpone cream, pour the water [1] into a saucepan and add the white sugar [2]. Stir gently and bring the mixture to 250°F (121°C), measuring the temperature with a food thermometer [3]; if you don’t have a thermometer, the syrup will be ready when small white bubbles form on the surface.
 
Just before the syrup reaches 250°F (so, around 240°F (115°C)), start to beat the eggs using a hand mixer or stand mixer [4]. Once the syrup has reached 250°F, pour the egg yolks in slowly, lowering the mixer speed while continuing to mix [5]. Continue to beat the mixture until it has cooled completely [6]. This is how you make pâte à bombe, the base for lots of confectionery creations.
In a bowl, soften the mascarpone using a spatula, then add the now-cooled egg yolk mixture a little at a time [7]. Slowly stir the mascarpone into the mixture using the whisks on the mixer or a spatula [8] so you get an even cream [9].
 
Your mascarpone cream is ready [10]! You can try it spread on a slice of panettone or pandoro or on its own in a glass [11], garnishing with sifted unsweetened cocoa powder if you like [12].
