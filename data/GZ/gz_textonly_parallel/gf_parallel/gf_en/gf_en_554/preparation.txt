To prepare bavette with pesto, start with the Genoese pesto; after picking [1] the basil leaves, remember not to wash them under running water, but clean them with a soft cloth, or place them in a bowl of cold water and rinse delicately [2]. Now place the peeled garlic in the mortar, together with a few grains of coarse salt. Start grinding and upon obtaining a garlic cream [3],
add the basil leaves along with a pinch of coarse salt [4]. Crush the basil leaves against the sides of the mortar by rolling the pestle left to right and rolling the mortar in the opposite direction (right to left) [5]; continue to coax a green liquid from the basil leaves [6].
Now add the pine nuts [7] and crush into a cream. Gradually add the cheese [8] for an even creamier sauce, and then last of all, gradually add the extravirgin olive oil [9], stirring with the pestle all the while.
Thoroughly amalgamate all the ingredients into a homogeneous sauce [10]. Bring abundant salted water to the boil in a saucepan and cook the pasta [11]. Now place the pesto in a large pan (remove from the heat) and temper with a little pasta cooking water [12].
Stir with a spatula (13-14) and as soon as the pasta is ready, add it straight to the pesto [15];
stir to flavor the dish (16-17) and lastly, serve your bavette with pesto garnished with a few basil leaves [18].
