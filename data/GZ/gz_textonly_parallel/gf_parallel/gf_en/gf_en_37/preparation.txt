To prepare the vegan tiramisu, start by making the base. Pour olive oil into a bowl, add brown sugar [1], and mix until almost completely dissolved [2]. In a separate bowl, sift the flour and cornstarch [3].
Add the yeast [4] and gradually incorporate the mixture of powders into the oil mixture; whisk together to avoid lumps [5]. While continuing to mix, also add the room temperature rice milk [6].
Mix the compound well and pour it into a 7 inch cake pan lined with parchment paper (7-8). Bake in a preheated static oven at 356째F (180째C) for about 45 minutes (or at 320째F/160째C for about 35 minutes if using a fan oven). Once ready, remove the base from the oven and let it cool at room temperature [9].
In the meantime, prepare the cream. Pour the tofu into a blender [10] and blend it until it becomes creamy; also add the brown sugar and blend again until the sugar has blended with the tofu [11]. Put the mixture you have obtained into a large bowl [12].
Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds using a knife. Add them to the tofu-based mixture [13], then whip the vegan cream [14] and gradually fold it in with a spatula using a bottom to top circular motion, so as not to deflate the mixture [15]. Transfer your cream to a pastry bag without a nozzle, which you can pierce with a hole, and store it in the refrigerator.
Once the base is cold, slice it into approximately 1/2 inch thick pieces [16]. Then, place 2 slices side by side and use a cookie cutter of the same diameter as the small cups to cut out disks [17]. Use the freshly prepared disks to line the base of 4 small cups with a capacity of 250 g and soak them with a spoonful of not too hot coffee [18].
Retrieve your pastry bag from the refrigerator and create a first layer of cream [19]; continue by placing another layer of sponge cake [20] and pour another teaspoon of coffee [21].
Finish off your small cups with a final layer of cream [22], then decorate the surface by distributing curls of dark chocolate [23]; refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. After the necessary time has passed, serve your vegan tiramisu nice and cold [24].
