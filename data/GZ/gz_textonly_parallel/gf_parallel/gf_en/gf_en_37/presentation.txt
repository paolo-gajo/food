Are you looking for a vegan dessert to finish off your dinner in style? The vegan tiramisu is just the dessert for you! It's a unique alternative to the classic and traditional tiramisu, made without eggs or mascarpone. When you dig your spoon in, instead of the typical ladyfingers, you'll find a sponge cake base made with olive oil, which gives it a delicate aftertaste. These soft layers soaked in coffee alternate with a fluffy cream, also prepared without animal derivatives, but made with tofu, made frothy thanks to the addition of vegan cream. These delicious tiramisu cups, served in pretty single portions, are finally topped with a cascade of dark chocolate curls, which give a crunchy and colorful note to the dessert. Are you curious? All you have to do is put on your aprons and bring this dessert to the table!
