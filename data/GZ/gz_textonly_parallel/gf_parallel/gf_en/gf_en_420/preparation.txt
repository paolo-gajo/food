To make four-cheese pasta with speck, first place a pot full of salted water on the stove and bring to a boil, ready to cook the pasta. Now turn to the cheese: cut the taleggio [1] and Gorgonzola [2] cheeses into cubes. Then cut a ½-inch (1-cm) slice of speck [3].
Remove the rind and cut the slice first into strips and then into cubes [4]. Now pour the pasta into the boiling water [5]. You’ll make the sauce in the time the pasta takes to cook. Add the cream and milk [6] to a small saucepan. 
Place over very low heat and once hot, add the cheese cubes [7] and grated cheese [8]. Stir with a wooden spoon [9] over low heat to get a 
creamy sauce [10]. Now heat a little oil in a frying pan [11] and add the speck [12].
Once golden brown, turn off the heat [13] and set aside a few tablespoons to garnish the pasta once served [14]. When the pasta is cooked, drain it and pour directly into the pan [15],
add the sauce [16], stir to coat [17], and serve your four-cheese pasta with speck piping hot [18]!
