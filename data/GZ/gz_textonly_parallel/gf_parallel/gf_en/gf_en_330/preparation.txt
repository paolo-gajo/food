To make the mussels au gratin, first of all clean them, discarding any open mussels and keeping only the closed ones. After rinsing them under running water [1], remove the beard that sticks out of the shells, by pulling outwards [2]. Open the mussel gently by inserting a small knife at the point where it splits and go all the way around [3],
making sure that when you open it, the mussel remains intact and attached to the shell [4]. Repeat the process with all of the mussels and keep their water [5], filtering it through a strainer [6], as this will be used later on to wet the breadcrumbs.
As you open the mussels, place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper [7]. Next, prepare the breadcrumbs. Pour them into a bowl, together with the grated Grana Padano cheese [8], the chopped fresh parsley [9],
the zest of the lemon [10], a crushed garlic clove [11] and a sprinkling of black pepper [12].
Now pour in 2½ tbsp (30 g) of olive oil [13] and ? cup (150 g) of filtered mussel water [14]. Stir to achieve a smooth, moist mixture [15].
Using a spoon, stuff the mussels [16], drizzle them with olive oil [17], and bake them on the top shelf of a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 12 minutes and then on maximum power in broil mode for another 3 minutes. Once cooked, take your mussels au gratin out of the oven and serve immediately [18].
