To prepare the pancakes, begin by gently melting the butter over a low flame; once melted, set it aside to cool. While the butter cools, focus on the eggs: separate the egg whites from the yolks. Place the yolks into a bowl [1] and whisk them vigorously. Next, incorporate the cooled, melted butter [2], ensuring it's at room temperature. Gradually pour in the milk [3], continuously stirring with the whisk to blend well. Add a pinch of salt to the mixture, and continue to beat until it turns a lighter color, achieving a smooth and homogenous texture. This careful process ensures your pancakes will have the perfect consistency and flavor.
Incorporate the yeast into the flour [4], then sift this mixture and add it to the bowl containing the yolk blend [5]. Gently mix in the sifted powders [6].
NowÂ whisk the egg whites you set aside earlier. Gradually incorporate the sugar [7] until the egg whites become white and frothy, forming soft peaks. Gently fold these whipped whites into the yolk mixture, using an upward motion from the bottom of the bowl to preserve the airiness [8]. This technique ensures your pancakes will be light and fluffy.
Next, heat your pancake pan or a non-stick skillet (preferably with a thick bottom) over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with a minimal amount of butter, evenly distributed using a piece of kitchen paper. This prevents sticking without making the pancakes too greasy.
Once the pan is heated, pour a ladle of batter into the center of the pan [9], allowing it to naturally spread into a round shape. The right temperature and technique here are crucial for achieving golden, evenly cooked pancakes.
Watch for bubbles to form on the surface of your pancake after about 2 minutes; this is your cue to flip it. Carefully use a spatula to turn the pancake over [10], and let it cook on the other side for approximately 30 seconds to achieve a perfect golden brown color [11]. This brief cooking time on the second side is crucial for maintaining the pancake's fluffy texture and even coloration.
Continue this process with the remaining batter, stacking the finished pancakes on a serving plate. With the specified amounts in your recipe, you should yield about 12 pancakes. Assembling them in a stack not only looks appealing but also helps retain their warmth.
Serve these delightful pancakes while they're still warm, drizzled generously with maple syrup [12]. The warm pancakes paired with the rich, sweet syrup make for an irresistible breakfast treat, perfect for starting your day on a delicious note!
