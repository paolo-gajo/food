To prepare the lemon delights you will first need to infuse the heavy cream with lemon to flavor it. To do this, first pour the cream into a bowl or pitcher, then add the sugar [1]. Remove the peel from the lemons using a vegetable peeler, taking care not to remove the bitter white part; then add them to the cream [2], mix with a whisk, and cover with plastic wrap [3]. Place in the refrigerator, at a temperature of around 39°F (4°C), for at least 12 hours.
