To prepare cold lemon cake, start with the base: melt the butter on a very low flame and leave to cool until lukewarm. Place the dry biscuits in a mixer [1] and blend into a powder. Place them in a bowl, add the melted butter [2] and leave to cool. Stir with a spoon [3].
Place the mixture in a 8" diameter hinged baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use the back of a spoon to evenly coat the pan with the biscuit mix [4]. Leave to harden in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the cream: place some cold water in a low and wide baking pan and soak the gelatine sheets [5] for around 10 minutes. Place the yogurt in a bowl, grate the zest of an untreated lemon [6]
then juice it [7]. Now add the juice to the bowl with all the other ingredients [8] and stir [9].
When ready [10], add the icing sugar to the cream [11], stir thoroughly so that it fully dissolves [12].
Heat 0.6 cups of cream taken from the total amount and heat to just before the boil. Take the gelatine and gently wring it out [13], add to the heated cream [14] and stir until fully dissolved. Leave to cool slightly before pouring into a bowl [15].
Stir to thoroughly incorporate both mixtures [16]. Then add the remaining cup of fresh liquid cream and beat with an electric whisk [17]. Now add also the whipped cream to the yogurt mix [18].
Stir delicately with a silicone spatula from the bottom up, so that the cream does not lose its frothy consistency [19]. Pour the cream onto the cold cake base, which will have firmed up by now [20]; smooth with a spatula or the back of a spoon [21] and place it back in the refrigerator to harden. It is best to wait a whole day or at least one night for the cake to solidify completely.
To decorate the cold lemon cake, finely chop the white chocolate [22], remove from the hinged baking pan and discard the parchment paper; now sprinkle the white chocolate over the entire surface of the cake [23]. Your cold lemon cake is ready to be enjoyed [24]!
