To prepare Canestrelli, start by boiling the eggs to make them hard-boiled: it will take 8 minutes in boiling water [1]; the hard-boiled yolks will be added to the dough to ensure the right crumbliness. In the bowl of a stand mixer, sift together the flour, cornstarch, and powdered sugar (2-3).
Then grate the zest of untreated lemon [4] and add the seeds of a vanilla bean [5]; also incorporate cold butter, cut into pieces [6]
and mix everything with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment to combine the ingredients [7]. When the eggs are hard-boiled, peel them [8] and keep only the yolk [9]
which you can mash and strain through a sieve to make it creamier and more homogeneous [10]. Then it will be added to the rest of the dough [11]. Briefly mix the ingredients with a stand mixer [11], transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and quickly compact it by hand [12],
just enough time to form a soft and smooth dough. Flatten it slightly and wrap it in plastic wrap [13] (or place it in an airtight container) and leave it in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. After the necessary time, roll out the dough into a 1 cm thick disk [14] and with a 3 cm diameter flower-shaped cookie cutter, cut out the cookies [15]; you can re-knead the scraps. In total, you will get 100 Canestrelli.
Then, create the typical central hole using a 1 cm diameter [16] cookie cutter (there are special Canestrelli cutters available on the market that allow you to directly form the central hole). Bake only a few Canestrelli at a time, spaced well apart, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper [17], in a preheated static oven at 170째C (338째F) for 18 minutes (you can also try with a convection oven, baking a first batch of a few cookies at 150째C [302째F] for 8-10 minutes): they should not brown. Once baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack, then dust them with powdered sugar [18] and serve the Canestrelli as tea cookies or store them in small bags to give away on a special occasion.
