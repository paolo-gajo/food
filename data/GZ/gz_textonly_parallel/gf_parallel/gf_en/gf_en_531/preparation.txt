To make butter and jam cookies, start with the dough: in a bowl, place the flour, sugar [1] and lightly beaten egg yolks [2]. Mix with your fingers [3].
Add the butter at room temperature in chunks [4] and knead until smooth and homogeneous [5]. Transfer the dough to the work surface [6]
and form a roll about 12 inches (30 cm) long, then wrap it in plastic wrap [7] and put it to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. After the resting time, take the dough roll and cut it into 3/4-inch (2 cm) thick discs, using a paring knife [8]: this recipe will yield about 15 cookies. Now preheat a static oven to 350째F (180째C) and line a baking tray with baking paper. Work the discs between the palms of the hands to form balls [9], then place them on the baking tray, well spaced apart.
With your index finger, press lightly into the center of each ball to form a small hollow [10], then bake in the static oven preheated to 350째F (180째C), on the lower shelf, for about 20 minutes. Once cooked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool down, then add a teaspoon of marmalade in the hollow [11] and sprinkle with plenty of powdered sugar: your butter and jam cookies are ready to be served [12]!
