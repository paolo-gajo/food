To prepare tasty chicken wings with potatoes, first pour the flour into a bowl and flour the chicken wings on one side [1] and the other [2], then remove the excess flour and place them on a tray [3].
In another bowl, pour the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese [4] and chopped parsley (set some aside for the final garnish) [5] and mix thoroughly [6]. Finally, beat the eggs in another bowl.
Dip the floured chicken wings first into the beaten egg [7] and then into the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese [8], pressing with your hands so that it adheres well. It is important to flour the meat first to prevent the breadcrumbs from flaking off during cooking. Once you have breaded all of the chicken wings [9], you can work on the potatoes.
Peel the potatoes and divide them first in half [10], then into quarters; then cut them into cubes [11]. Put the potatoes in a bowl and season them with oil and salt, then pour them into the bowl with the leftover breadcrumbs [12]
and stir well [13]. Take a large saucepan and place the breaded chicken wings [14] inside, then pour in the potatoes [15] and spread them evenly over the surface.
Season with a little salt and a generous dash of oil [16] and bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 390° F (200° C) for 40 minutes [17]. After, turn on the grill and continue cooking for another 10 minutes to make the breadcrumbs nice and crispy. Once cooked, garnish with the remaining parsley and serve your tasty chicken wings with potatoes steaming hot [18]!
