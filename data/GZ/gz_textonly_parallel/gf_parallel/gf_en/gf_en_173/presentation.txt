Rigatoni with sun-dried tomato pesto is a simple but flavorsome first course packed with Mediterranean flavors. This particular pasta shape helps conserve the flavor: The thick pesto sticks perfectly to the ridged insides and outsides of the pasta tubes! Sun-dried tomatoes, the main ingredient in this recipe, are typically dried in summer on the terraces of southern Italian houses and then preserved in oil when they develop their strong, savory taste. This goes well with equally tasty flavors such as the prawns in our gluten-free pasta dish! Sun-dried tomato pesto can be made in just a few simple steps: by adding just pine nuts, almonds, and basil you get a very dense and tasty sauce that’s ideal for those who crave the colors and aromas of southern Italy and perfect for lovers of intense, savory flavors. Once mixed, just add a little cooking water to bind the pasta and pesto even more tightly. Rigatoni with sun-dried tomato pesto allows you to bring a little piece of the Mediterranean to your table and will delight those who love strong flavors. All that’s left to do is for you to prepare it and… savor it!
