To prepare rigatoni with sun-dried tomato pesto, start by preparing the pesto. Pour the sun-dried tomatoes into the mixer without draining off any of the oil they’re preserved in [1], then add the pine nuts [2] and peeled almonds [3].
Lastly, add the basil leaves [4]. Blend until the mixture is slightly grainy [5], then transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Now heat some water in a saucepan, add salt, and pour in the pasta once it’s come to a boil [6].
Remove about 5 fl oz (150 ml) of cooking water and set aside [7]. Then drain the pasta two minutes before the cooking time stated on the package is up [8]. In the meantime, take the pesto and place it in the saucepan where the pasta was cooked [9], adding a little cooking water to make it creamier.
Add the rigatoni to the pesto [10], stir to color the pasta, and add more cooking water if necessary, adjusting according to the thickness of the sauce [11]. Stir to combine everything and cook for a further two minutes over low heat to keep the sauce from drying out. Now your rigatoni with sun-dried tomato pesto is ready to be served and enjoyed [12]!
