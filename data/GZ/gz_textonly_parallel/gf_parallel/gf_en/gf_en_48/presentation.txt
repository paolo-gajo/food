If you want to serve a refined dish that will win over even the most demanding of palates with an unmistakable aroma, then this first course is perfect for you! No complicated preparation required, just a few and meticulously selected ingredients: truffle fettuccine is a triumph of perfumes and flavors your guests will find hard to resist. Truffle, a precious underground mushroom loved by connoisseurs, is perfect for delicate flavored dishes like risotto or this egg pasta, but it is also delicious with poached egg, for filling vegetables like onions or served with a succulent fillet. However, there are a few expedients you should use to enhance the precious flavor of truffle, which is rather delicate to cook and store. The basic rule is to thoroughly remove all the soil and slice it very thinly, with a special truffle cutter, just a few minutes before serving, to preserve all its fragrance. You can use different types of truffle for the fettuccine we present you with; here we have chosen black summer truffle, but you could opt for Alba white truffle on a special occasion!
