To prepare truffle fettuccine, start by cleaning the truffle. Thoroughly rinse under cold running water to remove any excess soil [1], then use a semi-stiff brush [2] to remove all traces of impurities; carefully dry before placing it on a cutting board and cutting into slices [3].
Cut the truffle into very thin slices with a special truffle cutter [4] and leave to one side. Heat the oil [5] with the butter [6] in a pan; dissolve the latter on a low flame.
Peel the garlic clove (also remove the germ inside it) and lightly brown in the pan with the oil and melted butter [7] for a few minutes. Remove with a fork [8], then remove the pan from the heat and add the previously sliced truffle shards [9]. Leave a few pieces to one side for garnishing the dish when ready.
Remove from the heat and coax the flavors of the sauce by delicately stirring the truffle shards [10]; in the meantime, cook the egg fettuccine pasta in abundant salted water [11]. Drain when firm to the bite [12]
and add to the truffle sauce [13]; stir thoroughly, add a little pasta cooking water if necessary, so that the sauce binds to the pasta [14]. Serve the dish with a generous sprinkling of black truffle shards [15].
