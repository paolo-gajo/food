To prepare mini omelettes in pancetta bacon, start by setting the oven to 355°F (180°C). In a bowl, beat the eggs [1] with a fork, together with the milk [2], the cheese [3], the salt and pepper
and last of all, add the hand-torn basil [4], to season the mixture. Take a muffin tray and line each mold by crossing two slices of pancetta bacon to cover the entire surface [5]. There is no need to grease the molds: thanks to its fat content, the bacon will prevent the mixture from sticking to the tray, while also creating a deliciously crisp crust for the actual basket. Fill each of the molds to just below the edge with the mixture [6] (with these doses you should be able to fill 12 molds). Bake in the oven for 12 - 15 minutes, until the surface of the small omelettes is nice and golden. Once baked, remove the mini omelettes from the oven and serve them hot. You could always add some finely diced vegetables to the omelettes (zucchini, egg plants, mushrooms, artichokes).
