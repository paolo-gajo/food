To make spaghetti with clams, start by cleaning the clams. Make sure there are no broken or empty shells which have to be discarded. Then beat them against the sink or on a cutting board [1]. This step is important to check that there is no sand inside: healthy clams will remain closed, while those full of sand will open. Then place them in a colander over a bowl and rinse them [2]. Place the colander in a bowl and add plenty of coarse salt. Let the clams soak for 2-3 hours [3].
Once the time has passed, the clams will have purged any residual sand. Heat some oil in a pan [4]. Then add a clove of garlic and, as the oil takes on flavor, drain the clams well, rinse them, and plunge them in the hot pan [5]. Cover with a lid and let them cook for a few minutes over high heat [6].
The clams will open with heat, so shake the pan from time to time until they are completely open [7]. As soon as they are all open, turn off the heat immediately, otherwise the clams will cook too much. Collect the juice by draining the clams, and do not forget to discard the garlic [8]. In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water and drain halfway through the total cooking time of the spaghetti [9].
Then pour the sauce into a pan [10], add the spaghetti, and continue cooking using some cooking water. Your pasta will finish cooking in the pan. When cooked, add the clams and chopped parsley [11]. Heat everything on high for a few seconds and the spaghetti with clams is ready: serve immediately [12]!
