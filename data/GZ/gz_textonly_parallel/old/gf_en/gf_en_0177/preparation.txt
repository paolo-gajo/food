To prepare meatballs with tomato sauce, start with the meat mixture: cut stale bread into pieces and place it in a mixer with blades [1] and pulse until crumbly [2]. Set the crumbs aside and remove the twine from the sausages,
cut them gently lengthways [4] and finally remove the casing [5]. Squeeze the meat out with a knife blade or a fork [6],
then place it in a bowl together with the ground meat [7]. Add oregano, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and chopped parsley [8]. Finally, add grated Parmesan cheese and the breadcrumbs you made as well as an egg
and knead everything with your hands [10], adding salt and pepper [11] and mix until you have obtained a homogeneous mixture [12].
Use this mixture to form little balls weighing 7 oz each [13], taking a piece of the mixture and shaping it with both hands: with our quantities, you will obtain 24 meatballs [14]. As soon as all the meatballs are ready, heat some oil in a non-stick pan
and when the oil is hot, place the meatballs in the pan [16], cooking them on both sides for a couple of minutes [17]. Pour in tomato puree[18]
add water, season with salt and pepper [20], lower the heat and continue cooking for 15-20 minutes. Once ready, season with dried oregano and enjoy your meatballs with tomato sauce still hot [21]!
