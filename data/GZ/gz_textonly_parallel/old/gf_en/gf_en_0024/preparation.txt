Start by cleaning the mussels. First make sure they are all closed: discard those that are broken or open. Then remove any barnacles with a small knife [1] and pull out the hairy beard [2] that may stick out of the shell. Finally, scrape off the impurities with a clean scourer or stiff brush [3].
Rinse them thoroughly and move to the stove [4]. Heat a very large pot, put in the mussels [5] and add the black pepper immediately (it is better to grind the pepper when needed, as you will obtain a more aromatic and intense taste) [6].
Close with the lid and let the mussels [7] completely open. Occasionally shake the pot to stir. It will take 3-4 minutes [8]. At the end of cooking, remove the lid and place lemon slices and chopped parsley on serving plates. Your peppered mussels are ready: enjoy your meal [9]!
