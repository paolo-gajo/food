In the restaurants of seaside towns, this Neapolitan delicacy is a real must. It has conquered the palates of Italians and many more. We are talking about peppered mussels, known in Neapolitan dialect as 'a 'mpepata e cozze. It is an appetizer that is very easy, very quick to prepare, and just as tasty... and cheap. Usually peppered mussels are the opening dish for Sunday lunch, with the classic meat sauce or with oil. The original recipe for peppered mussels only contains two ingredients: mussels and pepper. There are those who add a pinch of parsley and those who enjoy them (as we did!) with squeezed lemon. Now are you ready to bring a bit of Naples to your table? Here's the recipe for peppered mussels!
