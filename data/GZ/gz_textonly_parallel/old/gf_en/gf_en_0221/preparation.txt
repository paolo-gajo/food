To make the heart-shaped cake, first chop the dark chocolate [1]. Take 3.5 oz (100 g) that will be used for preparing the dough and melt it in the microwave or bain-marie, then let it cool while stirring from time to time. Pour the sugar and butter at room temperature [2] into the mixer bowl, and beat until a creamy mixture is obtained. Add the eggs one at a time [3], making sure that each egg has been incorporated well before adding the next.
When you have obtained a frothy and homogeneous cream, add the cooled melted chocolate [4] and stir again to mix it with the mixture. At this point, add the salt [5] and sift the baking powder and flour directly into the bowl [6].
Then sift the bitter cocoa [7] and stir with a hand whisk to mix it all together [8]. Pour the dough obtained into a heart-shaped mold measuring 8.3 x 8.7" (21x22 cm) and level the surface with the back of a spoon [9]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 40-45 minutes. Then check if it's baked with a toothpick, take the cake out and let it cool a bit inside the mold before removing it and let it cool completely.
Meanwhile you can make the ganache: put 7 oz (200 g) of chopped chocolate in a bowl and bring 7 oz (200 g) of fresh cream to a boil [10]. Pour the cream on the chocolate in 3 parts [11], mixing well with a spatula [12]. Cover with plastic wrap and leave it to cool in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
After this time, pour the remaining 11 oz (300 g) of cream into a bowl and whip it with an electric mixer [13]. Add the whipped cream to the cold ganache [14] and fold gently from bottom to top to incorporate. Divide the mixture obtained into 2 bowls: one of 12 oz (350 g) that you use for preparing the filling, and the other of 11 oz (300 g) that will be used for the topping [15]. Put both bowls in the fridge. 
Move on to the candied hazelnuts: pour the hazelnuts and sugar into a saucepan [16] and cook over medium heat until the sugar has melted and become an amber colr [17]. Transfer the candied hazelnuts onto a sheet of baking paper and let them cool, then chop them finely with a mixer [18].
Now add the chopped hazelnuts to the 12 oz (350 g) of ganache for the filling [19] and mix to obtain a homogeneous mixture [20]. Put the filling into a bag with a smooth 1/2" (1 cm) [21] tip.
Take the completely cooled cake and even the surface using a bread knife [22], then cut the remaining part horizontally into 3 layers about 1/2" (1 cm) thick [23] [24].
Place the first layer on a plate and cover it with hazelnut ganache [25]. Spread the cream evenly with a spatula [26], add the second layer and cover it in the same way. Finally, add the last layer of cake [27] and leave in the refrigerator to set for about 15-20 minutes.
After this time, take the filled cake and cover both the sides and the top with the 11 oz (300 g) of ganache set aside for the topping, using a spatula to make it smooth and even [28]. Put the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the chocolate frosting: pour the water and sugar into a small pan [29], bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes [30].
Put 6 oz (170 g) of chopped dark chocolate into a bowl, then pour the syrup directly over the chocolate [31] and stir vigorously with a whisk. Add the honey [32] and stir again to obtain a homogeneous mixture [33].
Take the cake out of the refrigerator and set it on a rack that you have placed on a pan, then pour the frosting [34] over it to cover the cake evenly [35]. Put the frosted cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the water-based frosting for decoration by mixing the powdered sugar with the water in a bowl [36].
When you have obtained a smooth and uniform consistency [37], pour the frosting into a paper cone and write what you wish on the cake [38]. Decorate with edible flowers and serve your romantic heart cake [39]!
