To prepare zucchini parmesan, first start making the sauce. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the finely chopped onion [1] and let it brown over low heat. Then add the tomato puree [2] and a little water; add salt and let it cook for about 40 minutes over low heat, stirring frequently. Once cooked, add some hand-chopped basil leaves to the sauce [3].
In the meantime, wash the zucchini, trim [4] and cut them into slices about 1/4 inch (5 mm) thick using a knife [5]. Then put the oil over heat in a large pan and, while waiting for it to reach a temperature of 340째 F (170째 C), pass the zucchini in the flour [6]
so they are breaded on both sides [7]. As soon as the oil is at the right temperature (measured with a kitchen thermometer), dip a few slices at a time [8] and fry the zucchini slices for a few minutes until they are golden brown. Then drain them [9]
and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper [10] to drain the excess oil. Continue like this with the others, and salt them slightly if desired. Then cut the mozzarella into cubes [11] and set aside. As soon as the sauce is cooked, take a rectangular 11x7 inch (28x18 cm) baking pan and spread some tomato sauce on the bottom, spreading it with the back of a spoon [12].
Arrange the zucchini neatly side by side, slightly overlapping [13], covered with a generous layer of tomato sauce, then season with grated parmesan cheese [14], cubes of mozzarella and pepper [15].
Repeat the same procedure this time by arranging the zucchini horizontally [16], then add a layer of sauce, mozzarella, parmesan cheese and a dash of pepper [17]. Arrange the last layer of zucchini again lengthwise [18]
and top with the remaining sauce and mozzarella. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, a pinch of pepper [19] and bake in a static oven preheated to 390째 F (200째 C) for 25-30 minutes. Then bake the parmesan [20], add a few basil leaves and let it rest for a few minutes before serving!
