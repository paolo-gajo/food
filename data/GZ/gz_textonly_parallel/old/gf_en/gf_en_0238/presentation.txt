What is the classic homemade dessert par excellence? Definitely the pie! With master chef Iginio Massari we discover all the secrets to make apricot jam crostata (tart), with its soft and delicate shortcrust pastry, delicious filling and irresistible aroma of good and homemade. The secret to a perfect looking and tasting pie lies in letting the shortcrust rest: take all the time necessary, as the master chef suggests, preparing it the night before, then rolling it out and filling it the next day. Yes, because things (and pies) taste even better when they also look good.
