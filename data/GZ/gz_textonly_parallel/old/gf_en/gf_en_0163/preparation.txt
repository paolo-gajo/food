To make foil-baked sea bream, if your sea bream requires cleaning, proceed as follows: cut the belly with scissors and proceed straight up to below the head [1], then pull out the innards. Wash the belly of the fish well under running water [2] to remove all traces of blood. Using the same scissors, cut first the side fin near the head [3], the tail fin under the belly and finally the fin on the back of the fish. Turn the fish to the other side and remove the other fin and tail fin. Using a descaling tool, or the blade of a knife, carefully scale the sea bream, from the tail towards the head. Rinse the sea bream under running water again, washing it carefully also on the outside.
Wash and mince the parsley [4]. Place a sheet of baking paper on a baking tray and place each clean sea bream in the middle, seasoning the inside with salt [5] and pepper [6].
Proceed to stuffing the belly with the herbs: sprigs of thyme previously washed and dried [7], half a clove of peeled garlic for each sea bream, half a slice of lemon [8] and extra virgin olive oil [9].
Drizzle the sea bream with a little olive oil [10] then close the baking paper sheet by rolling up the two ends [11]. Wrap it in aluminum foil [12] 
and twist the ends to seal [13]. Place the sea bream on a baking tray [14] and bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for about 40 minutes. When cooked, take the sea bream out of the oven, let it cool, then serve it in the foil itself, sprinkling it with fresh parsley if you like [15].
