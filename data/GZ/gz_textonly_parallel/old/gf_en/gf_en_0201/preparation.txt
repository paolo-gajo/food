To prepare the lemon delights you will first need to infuse the heavy cream with lemon to flavor it. To do this, first pour the cream into a bowl or pitcher, then add the sugar [1]. Remove the peel from the lemons using a vegetable peeler, taking care not to remove the bitter white part; then add them to the cream [2], mix with a whisk, and cover with plastic wrap [3]. Place in the refrigerator, at a temperature of around 39°F (4°C), for at least 12 hours.
To prepare the domes, first make a sponge cake-type dough. Pour the eggs and egg yolks into the bowl of a planetary mixer [1]; both must be at room temperature (at least 64-68°F (18-20°C)) or else they will not whip. Add the sugar [2] and start beating at a moderate speed using the whisk. In the meantime, grate the lemon zest and add it to the whipped cream [3],
along with the seeds from the vanilla bean [4]. Beat the mixture for a total of 10-11 minutes, taking care not to overdo it, or else you will get porous domes rather than smooth ones. Meanwhile, sift both the starch and the flour onto a sheet of parchment paper [5], then move the sheet around to mix the powders together [6].
Once the eggs are whipped to the right consistency [7], add the sifted powders, mixing from the bottom up using a spatula [8] until they are completely incorporated [9].
Using a strainer, transfer the mixture into a lightly greased Formaflex mold (10-11) (each ball will be 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter) and bake in a conventional oven at 340°F (170°C) for 28 minutes. As soon as they are cooked and golden brown, remove from the oven [12] and leave to cool.
In the meantime, prepare the limoncello sauce. First, like before, remove the peel from the lemon [1] using a peeler. Next, pour the water and sugar [2] into a small saucepan and add the lemon zest [3].
Heat slightly, without letting it boil, until the sugar [4] is completely dissolved. Turn off the heat, add the limoncello [5], and leave to steep for at least 1 hour. Then remove the lemon zest [6] and leave to cool completely.
To prepare the lemon cream, which will be one of the components of the filling for the domes, first zest half a lemon. Then cut the lemons in half and squeeze them [1] so you get the juice out as well. Next, transfer both the juice and the zest to a small saucepan and bring to a boil [2]. Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in a bowl along with the sugar and vanilla bean [3].
Stir quickly with a whisk [4], and as soon as the lemon juice begins to boil, pour it into the yolk mixture [5], stir and transfer back to the saucepan [6].
Cook until it reaches a temperature of 175°F (80°C) (use a kitchen thermometer to measure the exact temperature), while continuing to stir slowly with a spatula [7]. At this point, transfer this lemon cream to a bowl to prevent it from overcooking, and remove the lemon peel [8]. Once it reaches a temperature of 105°F (40°C), add in the creamy butter [9]
and blend using an immersion blender [10] to obtain a smooth consistency [11]. Then cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator [12].
To prepare the pastry cream, first pour the milk and heavy cream into a small saucepan. Add the seeds from the vanilla bean, the pod, and the lemon zest [1], and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, pour the cornstarch, sugar, and salt [2] into a bowl. Mix well using a spoon and add the yolk of the egg [3].
Mix quickly with a whisk until the mixture is smooth [4]. This is the only way to make sure your cream won’t have lumps in it. As soon as the milk and cream come to a boil, transfer them to the yolk mixture, mix [5], and return everything to the saucepan before placing it back on the heat [6].
Cook, continuing to stir with a spatula [7] until the temperature reaches 185°F (85°C); use a thermometer to measure the exact temperature. Then transfer the mixture to a large, shallow casserole dish, remove both the lemon peel and the vanilla bean [8], cover with clear plastic wrap [9], and leave to cool in the freezer.
At this point, take the liquid cream that you left in the refrigerator to steep, remove the lemon zest [1], and whip all of this lemon-infused liquid cream using a hand mixer [2]. Then transfer 15 oz (430 g) of pastry cream to a bowl and add the limoncello [3].
Whisk the pastry cream and limoncello together before adding 10 oz (280 g) of lemon cream [4] you made in the earlier step. Whisk this together as well, and only at the end add in 10.5 oz (300 g) of the lemon-infused whipped cream [5]. Whisk again to blend everything into a smooth, consistent cream [6], then transfer to a pastry bag with a smooth nozzle.
At this point, you have the various components ready to go; all that remains is to assemble your dessert. Gently remove the small domes from the mold [1], before returning them to the mold and using the pastry bag to pierce the base and fill the small domes with plenty of cream [2]. The leftover cream will be used to make the glaze. Turn them out again [3]
and transfer them to a tray. Soak them with the limoncello sauce [4]; it may be easier to transfer this to a sauce bottle beforehand. Next, place the domes in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Now you need to make the glaze. Take the leftover filling, add in 10.5 oz (300 g) of whipped cream [5], and mix it all together. Then, add the cold milk a little at a time [6], 
and mix to achieve a smooth, fluid consistency [7]; adjust the amount of milk you need to add, depending on the consistency of the cream. At this point, dip each dome into the cream [8] before removing any excess [9]
and transferring them to a plate [10] as you go. Decorate your lemon delights with the remaining cream [11] and lemon zest [12]. Return to the refrigerator and leave to rest for at least 6 hours before serving.
