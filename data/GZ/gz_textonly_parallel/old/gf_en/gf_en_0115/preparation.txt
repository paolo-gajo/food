To prepare pasta alla zozzona, boil some water to cook the pasta and add salt. Take the guanciale, slice it [1] and cut it into strips [2]. Then remove the sausage from its casing [3]
and cut it into chunks [4]. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add the sausage [5] and guanciale [6], leaving them to brown for about 15 minutes over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally.
When they are well browned [7], add the cherry tomatoes to the pan [8] and cook for another 10 minutes with the lid on [9].
Pour the egg yolks into a bowl and add 9 tbsp (60 g) of grated Pecorino Romano cheese [10]. Mix them well to create a cream [11]. Boil the pasta [12]
then add a ladle of the pasta's cooking water to the mixture of egg yolks and Pecorino cheese [13] to thin out the resulting cream [14]. Drain the pasta al dente and pour it into the pan with the dressing [15],
mix well [16] and remove from the heat. Pour in the mixture of Pecorino cheese and egg yolks [17], stir well, and mix in another 6 tbsp (40 g) of Pecorino before serving your pasta alla zozzona (carbonara, amatriciana and cacio e pepe pasta) [18]!
