To prepare seafood salad, start by cleaning the fish. Start with the clams. If you notice any open or broken shells, discard them. Then dip them in a colander placed inside a bowl. Cover with fresh water and add plenty of coarse salt, as if to recreate sea water. Let them soak this way for a couple of hours [1]. Now it's the turn of the mussels. Rinse them under running water; with the back of a knife remove all barnacles and manually detach the beard [2]. Still under fresh running water and using a stainless steel pad (or a stiff brush), rub the mussels vigorously to remove any impurities. Once cleaned, set aside [3].
Clean the shrimp. Remove the head [4] and the tail, then with your fingers remove the shell [5]; cut the back and remove the gut (the black filament) by pulling it gently with the tip of a small knife (or use a toothpick) [6].
Take the calamari, remove the head and eliminate the internal cartilage [7]; rinse them under running water [8] and remove the skin and fins [9].
Cut the calamari into rings and set aside [10]. Then proceed to the cleaning of the octopus, put it on a cutting board and with a knife cut the bag at eye level to eliminate them [11]; discard also the tooth underneath [12].
Rinse the octopus under cool water, then pound the meat with a tenderizer. Remove the entrails from the head by carefully washing the inside of the bag [13]. Cut the celery and carrots [14] into coarse chunks, then place the bay leaves, parsley and peppercorns in a pot full of water. As soon as it starts boiling, dip the tentacles of the octopus 4-5 times. This will make them curl [15].
Then immerse the octopus completely in water, cover it with a lid and let it simmer for 30-35 minutes. From time to time you can remove the residue and foam that forms on the surface [16] of the cooking water. Before draining it, pierce the flesh with a fork to check that it is cooked: in the middle it should be soft but firm. When it is ready, lift it out of the pan, without throwing away the cooking water [17], and put it in a colander [18].
In the same cooking water as the octopus, first boil the calamari [19] for 5-8 minutes, depending on the size, and then the shrimps for 30 seconds. Drain and let cool [20]. In the meantime, drain the clams, rinse them and tap them on the chopping board, one by one, to make sure that there are no shells full of sand [21].
In the meantime, brown a clove of garlic with a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan. When the garlic is golden brown, pour in the mussels [22] and clams [23] and cook, covered, until they have opened up after about 5 minutes [24].
Check all the mussels and clams and discard any that have not opened. Turn off the heat and drain the shellfish. Remove the shells of the mussels and clams, keeping some whole to use as garnish [25]. Transfer the cold octopus to a cutting board and cut the tentacles into 1/8-inch (0.5 cm) pieces [26]. In a separate bowl prepare the dressing: pour in the lemon juice, the oil [27],
salt, pepper and chopped parsley [28]. Beat with a fork or whisk to emulsify the ingredients and pour over the mixture [29]. Toss and your seafood salad is ready to be served [30]!
