To prepare the sweet and savory crepes, start by breaking the eggs into a high-sided bowl [1], stir with a fork and add the milk [2]. Mix thoroughly to mix these two ingredients [3].
Place a strainer on the bowl and sieve the flour into the bowl [4], (for convenience you can also add it in two steps, mixing to avoid lumps). Whisk vigorously to blend in the flour [5]. Continue stirring until the mixture is homogeneous, smooth and lump-free [6].
Next, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This step is important to eliminate any lumps [7]. After this time, mix the batter [8], butter a crepe pan (or a non-stick 8-inch (20 cm) pan) and heat it. Once it has reached the desired temperature, pour a ladle of batter in the skillet, enough to cover the bottom: you can use a special crepe batter spreader or rotate the pan until the mixture is evenly distributed (be careful not to spread it all over the sides to avoid having not enough batter in the center to create a crepe with an even surface); for best results, work quickly, as the batter will harden very fast. [9]
After about 1 minute over medium-low heat, you will notice a slight browning, the edges will tend to curl up and you can turn the first crepe using a spatula [10]. Cook the other side for about 1 minute, waiting for it to turn a golden color [11]. Once the first crepe is cooked, transfer it to a serving dish or chopping board. Repeat these steps until you use up the batter. You should get 8 eight-inch (20 cm) crepes: stack them up so they stay soft. Here are your sweet and savory crepes ready to be filled [12]!
