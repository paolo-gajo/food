To make the Nutella swirls, first prepare the roulade dough: break the room-temperature eggs into a bowl, flavor with the vanilla extract [1], pour in the sugar [2], and beat at medium speed using a hand mixer [3];
it will take a few minutes for it to become light and frothy [4]. Fold in the sifted flour [5], stirring gently from top to bottom with a spatula [6].
Now divide the mixture in half and pour into two separate bowls [7]. Add the cocoa powder to one of the bowls, sifting it [8] and mixing gently from top to bottom so that the mixture does not separate [9].
Grease a 12x15-inch (30x38-cm) sheet pan and then arrange parchment paper on the base and sides, ensuring it is well stuck down. Pour in the light-colored mixture [10], level the surface with a spatula [11], and bake in a preheated conventional oven at 350°F (180° C) (placing the sheet on the on the top rack) for 10-12 minutes. Once cooked, take the roulade dough out of the oven and immediately pour the dark-colored mixture over it [12].
Spread the mixture evenly with a spatula [13] and then bake for a further 10 minutes in a conventional oven at 350°F (180°F), again on the top rack. Once cooked, take the roulade dough out of the oven [14] and cover the surface with a sheet of parchment paper [15].
Then cover this with a dish towel to keep it from drying out [16]. Leave the roulade dough base to cool. Once it has reached room temperature, gently remove the parchment paper [17], carefully turn the roulade dough over and remove the parchment paper from the light-colored side, still working very gently [18].
Even off the edges with a knife, then place the base back on a sheet of parchment paper, add the Nutella [19] and spread it out with a spatula, stopping ½ in (1 cm) from the ends of the long sides, then start to roll up the base with the aid of the parchment paper [20]. Once you’ve made a roll [21],
wrap it in parchment paper, carefully sealing the ends [22], and leave to set in the fridge for an hour. Once this time is up, take out the roll, which should now be very firm [23], and slice it [24] 
into 12 swirls [25]. Now add the topping: chop up the dark chocolate [26] and melt in a bain-marie [27] or microwave.
Dip the swirls in the melted chocolate on one side only [28] and leave them to dry on a rack [29]. Once the chocolate has set, your Nutella swirls are ready to be enjoyed [30]!
