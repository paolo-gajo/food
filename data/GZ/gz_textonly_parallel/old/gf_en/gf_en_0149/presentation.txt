Meat can be cooked in many ways, depending on the culture, personal taste, the dish you want to prepare... and each time is a different culinary experience. We can go from strips that are stir-fried, to boiled, to stewed... just to give a few examples. Surely one of the best recipes to taste meat in all of its purity is the sliced beef steak. To prepare it skillfully, it is wise to select the right cut (entrec√¥te or sirloin), take it out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature before cooking, and pay attention to the timing to get a soft, juicy and perfectly pink meat inside. The sliced beef tagliata with arugula and cherry tomatoes will be perfect to serve for a dinner with friends or whenever your meat-loving guests want to enjoy a succulent and hearty main course.
