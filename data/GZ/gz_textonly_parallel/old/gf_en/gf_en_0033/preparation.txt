To prepare tomato bruschetta, first wash the tomatoes, divide them in half [1] and then cut them into cubes [2]. Pour the cut tomatoes into a bowl and add basil leaves, previously washed and dried [3].
Season with a pinch of oregano [4], salt [5], pepper and oil [6]. Stir well and let the flavors blend for about 30 minutes. This step is optional, but we recommend it to enhance scents and flavors.
Meanwhile, cut the bread into slices [7]. After the resting time, heat a grill and place the slices of bread on it [8]. Grill them on both sides until toasted [9].
Now top the bread slices with your tomato salad [10], drizzling a little more oil [11]. Let rest for a couple of minutes, then serve your tomato bruschettas [12]!
