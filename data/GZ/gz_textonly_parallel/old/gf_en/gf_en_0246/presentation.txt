Danubio salato (Savory pull-apart bread) is one of the most famous rustic foods of Neapolitan cuisine; together with savory bab√†, casatiello, and tortano, they are a must at parties. Its captivating shape recalls conviviality: once placed in the middle of the table, each ball must be detached by hand! These soft morsels hold a tasty filling to be savored bite after bite. The origin of this recipe is linked to two legends: the first one attributes the birth of the bread to the Austrian aunt of the famous Neapolitan pastry chef Scaturchio, the other refers to the time of the Bourbons with the marriage of Ferdinand I and Maria Carolina of Habsburg Lorraine and the culinary influences of Viennese chefs. The roots of this appetizing dish are unclear, but its delicious taste is certain!
