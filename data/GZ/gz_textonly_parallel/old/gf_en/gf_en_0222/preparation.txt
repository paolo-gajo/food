To prepare chiacchiere, sift the flour together with the yeast and pour it into a stand mixer fitted with a spatula attachment. Add sugar [1], salt, previously beaten eggs [2] and grappa [3]. Mix all the ingredients well.
Replace the spatula with the hook attachment [4], add the vanilla bean seeds and butter [4], then continue kneading for 15 minutes until a homogeneous mixture is obtained [5]which should be firm, but fairly soft to the touch. If necessary, you can add 1-2 teaspoons of water. Transfer the dough onto a work surface, and quickly shape it into a ball [6].
Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes [7]. Next, divide the dough into portions of about 5 oz (150 g) each and start kneading each individually. Flatten a first portion slightly with the palm of your hand [8], sprinkle it with flour and roll it out with a pasta machine set to the widest thickness [9].
Fold the short sides of the strip of dough towards the center [10], then continue to roll it out using an increasingly thinner setting on the pasta machine each time, until it reaches a thickness of 0.88" (2 mm) [11]. Do the same with the remaining portions of dough. Let the rolled dough rest for a few minutes and in the meantime bring the oil to a temperature of 300° F (150-160° C). Using a pastry wheel, cut the dough into 2-inch x 4-inch (5 x 10 cm) rectangles and make two central cuts on each shape, parallel to the long side on each one [12].
As soon as the oil has reached the right temperature, dip 2-3 rectangles of dough with the help of a skimmer [13] and cook them turning them on both sides until they are golden brown. Drain the fritters on a paper towel. Once they are cold, place them on a plate and sprinkle them with plenty of sifted powdered sugar [14].Your chiacchiere are ready [15].
