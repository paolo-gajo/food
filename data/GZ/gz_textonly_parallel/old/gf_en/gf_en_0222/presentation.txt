Chiacchiere are crispy and delicate fried pastries typical of the Carnival period and are called by different names according to the regions of origin: chiacchiere and lattughe in Lombardy, cenci and donzelle in Tuscany, frappe and sfrappole in Emilia, cr√≤stoli in Trentino, galani and gale in Veneto, bugie in Piedmont, as well as rosoni, lasagne, pampuglie, etc. They are a very crumbly sweet dessert, obtained by rolling out very thinly a plain dough, which is then fried and dusted with powdered sugar for the final touch. Their rectangular shape, with two clean central cuts, makes chiacchiere unmistakable and an irresistible treat for children and grown-ups alike. Their presence in the shop windows renders the air immediately sparkling and cheerful, together with plain or stuffed castagnole, bugie and zeppole! Whether it's the first or the millionth time you taste one, every bite of chiacchiere is magic and it's instantly Carnival! Enrich your tray of Carnival treats with Carnival roses as an original alternative!
