Ice-cold water, cold butter, and flour are the three simple ingredients you’ll often turn to for a basic recipe that’s quick and easy to make: pie dough. This neutral dough can be combined with the filling of your choice to make a summertime savory pie, maybe with zucchini or eggplant, which is always tasty and colorful, always something different, and the perfect accompaniment to an aperitif or rustic appetizer. We were inspired by this idea of rusticity to make this rustic savory pie, using tasty speck, Fontina cheese, and crispy potato slices. The most fun part of this recipe will no doubt be creating the edge of the pie... Check out how we did it and send us your own original and creative variations!
