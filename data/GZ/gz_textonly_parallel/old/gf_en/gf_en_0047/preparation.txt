To prepare the rustic savory pie, start with the pie dough. Pour 00 flour into a food processor and add the refrigerated butter in small pieces [1]. Then add the salt [2] and the water, which should be ice-cold [3]. Blitz in the food processor for just long enough to get a crumb-like consistency.
Pour the mixture out onto a work surface [4] and knead quickly by hand [5] to obtain a compact and fairly elastic dough [6].
Shape it into a rectangle, wrap in plastic wrap [7], and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, wash and peel the potato, and cut it into thin slices around? inch (2-3 mm) thick using a mandoline [8] or a knife. Transfer the slices to a bowl filled with fresh water to keep them from turning black [9].
Take the speck and cut it into strips around? inch (3-4 mm) wide [10], then move on to the fontina cheese, cutting it first into strips [11] and then into cubes of around ½ inch (1 cm) [12].
Once the pie dough has rested for the required amount of time, use a rolling pin to roll it out on a lightly floured [13] work surface to obtain a sheet of around? inch (4-5 mm) thick [14]. Cut a ring out of the dough using a 9-inch (24-cm) [15]
food ring mold and set aside the excess dough [16] to make the edge of the rustic savory pie later on. Next, take a 9-inch (24-cm) mold (preferably with a removable bottom) and place the disc of pie dough over it [17]. Knead the leftover dough by hand to compact it again [18],
then start to work it with your hands to create a strip [19] that should be around 60 inches (1.5 m) long, which you will then fold in half [20]. Starting with the joined side, roll the strip around itself to create a braid-like effect [21]. 
Once you’ve finished [22], seal the loose ends and roll the dough rope around itself like a snail [23]. Unroll the rope inside the pan as you go to create the edge of your rustic savory pie [24]. When you are done, seal the ends.
Preheat a conventional oven to 375°F (190°C), then move on to filling your pie base. Lay the strips of speck on the bottom then cover with diced Fontina cheese [25] and finally remove the potato slices from the cold water they have been soaking in, drain them, and arrange them, slightly overlapping, to carefully cover the entire surface [26]. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then sprinkle with the thyme leaves and paprika [27].
Finally, brush the edges of your rustic pie with milk [28]. Bake the pie in a preheated conventional oven for 60 minutes at 375°F (190°C). Once cooked, take your rustic savory pie [29] out of the oven and let it cool down before turning it out and serving it on a plate [30].
