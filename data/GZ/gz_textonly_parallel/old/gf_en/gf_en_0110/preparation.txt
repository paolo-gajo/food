To make crespelle (crepes) cannelloni pasta, first prepare the sauce: chop the onion, celery and carrot for the sauté, then pour some olive oil into a large pan [1], add the vegetables [2] and leave to brown for 5 minutes. Then add the ground beef and pork [3] and brown over high heat for about 7-8 minutes.
Sweat with white wine [4], let it evaporate, then pour in the water [5] and the tomato puree [6]. Stir and continue cooking for about 3 hours or until the sauce has thickened.
In the meantime, prepare the béchamel sauce: heat the milk in a saucepan [7]; separately, melt the butter over low heat [8], then turn off the heat and add the cup (100 g) of flour all at once [9],
whisking quickly to prevent lumps from forming [10]. Put the pan back over low heat and stir until it becomes golden; pour a little hot milk over the butter and flour mixture to dilute the bottom [11], then add the rest, whisking all along. Add salt and nutmeg to taste. [12]
Cook for 5-6 minutes over low heat until the sauce thickens [13]. Let it cool and prepare the crepes: thoroughly mix the milk [14] and eggs in a bowl. [15]
Sift the flour directly into the bowl with the milk and eggs [16], then whisk [17] to obtain a smooth, lump-free mixture [18]. Next, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This step is important to eliminate any lumps.
Butter a crepe pan (or a non-stick 8-inch (20 cm) pan) and heat it. When hot, pour a ladle of crepe batter [19] in the pan, enough to cover the bottom: help yourself with the crepe batter spreader or rotate the pan to distribute the batter evenly. After about 1 minute over medium-low heat, you will notice a slight browning [20], the edges will tend to curl up and you can turn the first crepe using a spatula. Cook the crepe on the other side for about 1 minute. As you cook them, transfer the crepes onto a plate [21] and set them aside. This recipe will yield 8 crepes.
In the meantime, the sauce will have reached the right consistency, season with salt and pepper, add the peas [22] and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Once the sauce [23] is ready, transfer it to a bowl and dilute it with a spoonful of béchamel sauce [24].
Cut the scamorza cheese into cubes [25] and take a 14x9-inch (36x24 cm) rectangular baking dish. Spread a layer of béchamel sauce on the bottom [26], sprinkle with breadcrumbs and make the cannelloni (filled pasta tubes): lay a crepe on a cutting board, fill the center with the sauce and a few cubes of scamorza cheese [27].
Roll up the crepe [28] to create the cannellone (filled pasta tube) and place it in the pan [29]. Keep going this way until you have used up all the remaining crepes. Once you have filled the baking dish, spread a generous layer of béchamel sauce on top [30],
Flavor with thyme sprigs [31] and season with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese [32]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for about 10 minutes, then switch to grill mode at 460°F (240°C) for 5 minutes or the time needed to brown the surface. When cooked, let your crespelle (crepes) cannelloni pasta cool down slightly and serve [33].
