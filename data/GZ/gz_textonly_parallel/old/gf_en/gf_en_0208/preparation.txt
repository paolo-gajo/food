To prepare the strawberry cake, start by melting the butter over gentle heat, then let it cool down. Separate the egg whites from the yolks of the 2 eggs required for the recipe. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer [1] until stiff [2]. Wash and hull the 9oz (240g) of strawberries and place them in a food processor [3].
Pour in the 2 yolks [4], the sugar [5] and the juice of half a lemon [6].
Add the flour [7] and yeast [8]. Blend it all together until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. Then pour in the melted butter.
Blend again to mix the butter with the rest of the ingredients [10]. Now you can add the mixture to the strawberries and egg whites, gently folding with a rubber spatula from top to bottom [11] to keep the mixture as airy as possible. Butter and flour a 9-inch (23 cm) round mold [12].
Pour the mixture into the mold [13], then bake the cake at 350°F (180°C) for about 55 minutes in a preheated static oven. Once ready [14], take your cake out of the oven and let it cool down. Unmold it. Prepare the filling: wash and hull the strawberries and cut them into slices [15].
Whip the fresh cream with a mixer, using refrigerated beaters and bowl if possible [16]. Now that the cake is cold, you can cut it in half [17] [18].
Cover the base with strawberry jam [19], whipped cream [20] and strawberry slices [21].
Then place the other disc of cake over the filling [22], decorate the surface [23] with icing sugar and garnish with fresh strawberries [24]. Your strawberry cake is ready to be enjoyed!
