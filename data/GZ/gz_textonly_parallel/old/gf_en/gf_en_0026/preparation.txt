To prepare taralli, start by kneading the ingredients in a bowl, or, if you prefer, in a stand mixer equipped with a hook. Pour in the flour, salt [1] and oil [2] and stir briefly until you get a crumbly mixture [3].
Now add the wine [4], mix everything together [5] and transfer the mixture to a pastry board by hand for about ten minutes [6].
Take off some small pieces of dough and shape them with your fingertips to form a strip [7] 1/3 inch (1 cm) thick and about 4 3/4 inches (12 cm) long [8]. Then join the tips by folding one end over the other, so as to obtain a sort of doughnut. Keep in mind that these amounts and this procedure will make about 60 pieces [9]. Meanwhile, boil a pot of water.
As you shape them, place the taralli on a tray with baking paper [10]. When you have formed all the taralli, immerse a few pieces at a time in boiling water with the help of a skimmer [11]. As soon as they rise to the surface, they will be ready to be drained on a tray lined with a clean cloth; continue cooking the others [12].
Transfer the pieces to a drip pan with baking paper [13] and bake in a static oven preheated to 375° F (190° C) for about 40 minutes [14]. Your taralli are ready, enjoy [15]!
