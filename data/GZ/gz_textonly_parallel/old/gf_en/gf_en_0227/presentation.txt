Torta tenerina (Moist chocolate cake) is traditional dessert from the city of Ferrara, but its delights have conquered all of Italy. No one can resist a slice of this fantastic cake! Is it because of its fragrant external crust, or its texture that melts in the mouth with each bite? We fell in love with both of them, but one thing is certain: its intense chocolate flavor makes everyone agree! The moist chocolate cake contains few ingredients and it is without yeast, which allows it to remain low and moist inside, just as the name suggests: in the dialect of Ferrara it was also called "Torta Taclenta", which means "sticky cake". It is a simple dessert to make, with guaranteed success: to enhance its flavor, try serving it together with a delicate mascarpone cream and enjoy its delights! It is perfect for any occasion, as well as Father's Day!
