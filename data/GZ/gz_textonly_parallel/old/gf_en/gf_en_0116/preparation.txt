To prepare passatelli, start by heating a good meat broth. While it's cooking, grate the lemon zest (being careful not to grate the white part, which is bitter), and set it aside [1]. Do the same with the eggs, beat them for a few moments in a bowl together with a pinch of salt and set aside [2]. In a larger bowl, pour the breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese [3].
Add the lemon zest [4], season with grated nutmeg [5] and pour in the eggs [6].
Mix the ingredients with the help of a spatula [7] or by hand if desired, and mix until the dough is elastic and compact [8]. If it is too dry, add a very small quantity of broth; if it is too soft, add some breadcrumbs. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours [9]. This will make the mixture more compact and prevent the passatelli from coming apart while cooking.
Once the dough has finished resting, mash with a potato masher with wide holes [10] directly into the boiling broth [11].Use the blade of a knife to cut the passatelli to a length of approximately 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) [12].
Cook your passatelli [13]. As soon as they rise to the surface, transfer them to a serving plate [14]. Serve the passatelli in hot broth [15], top with grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper if desired!
