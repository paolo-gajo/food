Emilia Romagna is the cradle of good food and handmade meals, such as fresh egg pasta. Making it requires a "dance" with a precise rhythm and swaying, while the hands work the dough. We want to immerse you in another traditional dance of this region, a true specialty: passatelli (homemade pasta) in broth. Characteristic movements to follow also exist to make this particular type of pasta with eggs, breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese. When using the traditional tool to prepare passatelli, you will need to squish, pull, and use force with patience. Since not everyone has this tool at their disposal, we have chosen to use a potato masher with wide holes. It is a very simple and easily accessible method that will allow you to make textbook passatelli in broth, perfect for your Christmas menuÂ or New Year's Eve dinner!
