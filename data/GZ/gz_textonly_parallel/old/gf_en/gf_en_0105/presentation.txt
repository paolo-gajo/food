Tomatoes: what a treat! The versatility of this product, originally imported from South America, has been the driving force behind its success in Italian cuisine! In this recipe, the juicy and fresh "King of Summer" bends over backwards: we have chosen the sweet cherry variety for the spicy spaghetti nests, a juicy passata, and a concentrate to give a more intense flavor. By rolling up the spaghetti in this lovely presentation, you will not only envelope all the richness of the tomato, but also the spicy notes of fresh chili pepper in an irresistible combination for those who love dishes with a bite!
