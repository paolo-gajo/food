To prepare spicy spaghetti nests, start by washing the tomatoes [1]. Dry [2] and cut them into quarters [3]. Set aside.
Then finely chop the onion [4] and brown it in a non-stick pan with a drizzle of oil [5]. Then remove the seeds from the chili pepper and cut it into thin strips [6].
Add to the frying pan [7] and smooth out with a spatula [8]. Add the tomatoes [9]. Warm over moderate heat for 7-8 minutes.
Now add the tomato puree [10] and season with salt and pepper [11]. Add tomato paste [12].
Mix the ingredients well with a spatula [13] and cook for another 30 minutes over very low heat. When cooked, add the coarsely chopped basil to flavor [14]. Boil the spaghetti in plenty of salted water [15].
One minute before it has finished cooking, drain the pasta, and pour it into the pan with the sauce [16]. Mix the ingredients well so that the sauce is mixed evenly with the spaghetti [17]. Finally, plate the spaghetti with spicy sauce by creating three small nests in the dish: just pick up some of the pasta with a fork. While you roll it up on the fork, use a spoon to prevent the pasta from falling off. Then gently place the spaghetti nests on the plate and decorate them with a few washed and dried basil leaves. Your spicy spaghetti nests are ready to be enjoyed [18]!
