To prepare the baked prawns, start by cleaning them, removing the legs and the hard upper shell [1], but taking care not to remove either the head or the tail, which should be left attached to the shrimp [2] for decoration. Now remove the digestive tract by cutting along the back of the prawn with a small knife [3]
and removing the dark “vein,” [4] pulling it gently with the blade of the knife or a toothpick [5]. Wash the bunch of parsley and chop it very finely. Squeeze the lemon juice [6],
then prepare the citronette dressing [7] that will be used to flavor the baked jumbo shrimp by placing the parsley in a small bowl, pouring in the lemon juice and olive oil [8], and adding salt and pepper [9] to taste.
Emulsify the sauce well [10] and set aside. Take a rectangular baking dish, arrange the cleaned prawns close together side by side [11], and pour the citronette dressing directly over them to flavor [12].
Cover the prawns with a sheet of parchment paper [13] to retain the moisture and keep them tender. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 10-12 minutes. When cooked, take the prawns out of the oven [14] and serve hot [15]!
