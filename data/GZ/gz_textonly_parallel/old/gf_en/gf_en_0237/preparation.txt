To prepare the pastry cream first put a glass bowl in the freezer. Now cut the seeds out of the vanilla pods [1] and cut the pods into pieces [2]. Pour the milk into a pan and add both the seeds [3] and the vanilla pods.
Cut the rind from the lemon, taking only the yellow part, and put it in the pan [4]. Turn on the burner and heat it all together at a boil, stirring from time to time. In another saucepan, pour the yolks, sugar and rice starch [5]. Using a soft whisk, stir to obtain a smooth, creamy consistency [6].
As soon as the milk is close to boiling, add it into the yolks in 3 parts, filtering it with a strainer [7] and constantly stirring with a whisk [8]. Put back on the burner and stir continuously until it thickens [9].
To cool it quickly, take the bowl out of the freezer and pour the cream inside [10]. Stir with a whisk very quickly, until you have brought the cream to 120° F (50° C), below the cooking point. You need to have a smooth and very shiny cream [11]. At this point the custard is ready [12], you can use it or store it in the fridge by covering it with plastic wrap.
