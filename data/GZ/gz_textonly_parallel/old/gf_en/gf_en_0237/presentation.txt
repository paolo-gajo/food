Eggs, milk, sugar and vanilla. Few ingredients to make one of the most popular creams: Pastry cream. This cream is among the most used in confectionery, such as chantilly or zabaglione, to fill many pastries. In beignets, puff pastry cakes (such as cannoncini, vol-au-vent, millefoglie), but also in the soft layers of the classic Pan di Spagna (Sponge cake) pastry cream is always welcome, flavored too: pistachio, lemon, coffee, orange! This basic pastry preparation is also used to make semifreddo, puddings and many spoon cakes, such as our delicious Brick cake (Layered no-bake cake). It's a very versatile cream: just change the amounts of some ingredients to obtain different consistencies suitable for the use you will make of them! For example, to thicken it more, you just use more corn starch; or the reverse, if you want soft desserts, just reduce the amount.
