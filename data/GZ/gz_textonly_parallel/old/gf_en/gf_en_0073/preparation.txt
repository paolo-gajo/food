To make a classic rice salad, place a pot full of salted water on the stove. Once it is boiling, pour in the peas [1] and blanch them for about 3 minutes. Once the peas have been drained [2], pour the rice [3] into the same water. Cook the rice 2-3 minutes less than the cooking time indicated on the package.
In the meantime, prepare the seasoning: wash the peppers, remove the stem, seeds and internal filaments [4], cut them first into strips and then into cubes (5-6) and place them in a large bowl where you will collect all the other ingredients.
Wash and cut the tomatoes in half [7], dig out the pulp with a teaspoon [8] and cut them into cubes [9].
Dice the baked ham (prosciutto cotto) [10]. Also cut the caciocavallo cheese into cubes [11] and cut the pickles [12]
and pitted olives into rounds [13]. When about 2-3 minutes are left before it finishes cooking, drain the rice [14] and let it cool by placing it on a cold tray [15] (previously stored in the refrigerator) in order to facilitate cooling.
Flavor the seasoning with chives cut into small pieces [16], add the peas and rice that will have cooled in the meantime [17]. To finish, add the crumbled tuna [18]
and the baked ham, adjust the salt and stir with a spoon [19]. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap [20] and let sit in the refrigerator until serving so it will be cold and the flavors will have blended together [21].
