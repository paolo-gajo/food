To pasta with tuna, boil plenty of salted water to cook the pasta. In a pan, let the whole peeled garlic sizzle for a few moments in oil, then remove it [1]. Add the drained anchovy fillets in oil and melt them with a little cooking water from the pasta [2]. Then add the fresh chili pepper cut into strips, ideally without the seeds to reduce its spiciness [3].
While everything is seasoning, drain the oil from the tuna [4] and place the tuna into the pan [5]. Let it season, then wet with a bit of cooking water from the pasta [6].
Add the tomato puree [7] and cook for about ten minutes. You have just enough time to cook the pasta in boiling salted water [8]. So as soon as the pasta is al dente, drain and add it to the sauce [9].
After few moments [10], add salt, pepper and chopped parsley to taste [11]. Your pasta with tuna is ready. Buon appetito [12]!
