To make the sea bass in a herb salt crust, start by scaling the fish with a scaler or the back of a knife to avoid damaging the flesh. Rinse thoroughly under running water. Pour the herbs and peeled garlic clove into the bowl of a blender. Chop the herbs and transfer them to a bowl. Alternatively, chop all the herbs [1] using a knife [2]. Grate the lemon zest [3] and add to the chopped herbs.
Stuff the belly of the sea bass with a spoonful of the herb mix [4]. Meanwhile, pour the egg whites into a bowl [5] and beat them with a hand mixer until stiff [6]. 
Gently mix in the herbs [7]. Stir, add the fine and coarse salt [8] a little at a time [9], and mix everything together.
Stendete un foglio di carta forno su una leccarda e poi adagiatevi un sottile strato (circa 1,5 cm) del composto ottenuto [10]. Appoggiate quindi sopra il letto di sale il branzino [11] e ricopritelo con il composto di sale pressandolo delicatamente per fare aderire bene l’impasto [12].
and making sure that the fish is entirely covered [13].Bake the sea bass in its herb salt crust in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 30 minutes. Once the fish is cooked, remove it from the oven and leave to rest for a few moments [14]. Then, take a small hammer or meat tenderizer, break the salt crust [15], fillet the fish and serve hot!
