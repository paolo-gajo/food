Thinking about South Asian cuisine, unique and spicy dishes immediately come to mind – especially chicken curry! This dish is packed with flavor and its unmistakable color that immediately gives away its Indian origins. The main characteristic of this recipe is the blend of spices, a particular and special fragrance that varies from city to city based on different tastes. Curry spice, or masala more precisely, is actually a mix created by grinding different spices and can be purchased ready-made or easily created at home. We’ve gone for the second option and will show you how to make a mix using spices such as turmeric, which gives the dish its typical yellow color; cayenne pepper, which provides a subtle heat and intoxicating aroma; and cumin, which will be the dominant note! When the spices release their aromas in the pan, your home will be filled with their fragrance, making you feel like you’ve been whisked away to a classic spice market!
