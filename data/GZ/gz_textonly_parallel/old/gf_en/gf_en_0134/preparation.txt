To make the chicken curry, start by preparing the marinade: Pour the spices into a pan [1] and toast them over low heat for just a few minutes [2], then transfer them to a large bowl [3].
Add a pinch of salt [4] and pepper, then add the Greek yogurt [5] and stir all together to get a creamy mixture with an even color [6].
At this point, chop the chicken breast into ½-inch (1.5-cm) cubes [7] and place the cubes in the marinade [8]. Mix all together, cover with plastic wrap [9], and leave to marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours. If you prefer, you can leave the chicken to rest for just 10-15 minutes. However, the longer you leave it to marinate, the more the aromas will infuse and liven up the meat!
Once the chicken has marinated, start to prepare the rice accompaniment. Rinse the rice well, then pour into a saucepan, add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and star anise. Add the coarse salt [10] and water [11]. Cover with a lid [12] and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and leave to cook for 8-10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the chicken. Slice the onion very thinly (or, if you prefer, you can mince it) [13]; grate the fresh ginger [14] and cut the chili into pieces, removing the stem but keeping the seeds [15].
Pour the oil into a pan, crush the garlic into it [16], then add the onion, ginger, and chili [17]. Fry lightly over medium heat and then add the chicken, together with all of the marinade [18].
Leave to cook for 8-10 minutes [19] and in the meantime, chop the coriander leaves finely [20]; you’ll add them to the pan at the last minute when the chicken is nearly done [21].
At this point, both the chicken curry [22] and the basmati rice [23] will be ready. Now you just have to serve them [24]!
