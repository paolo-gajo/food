To prepare your fruit salad, start by squeezing a lemon [1] and pouring the juice into a large bowl [2]. Add the oil [3] and a pinch of salt.
Emulsify the mixture thoroughly using a whisk [4]. Next, prepare the fruit. Cut the nectarine in half and remove the stone [5], then cut into thin slices [6].
Put the nectarine in the bowl and stir [7]; the lemon juice will prevent it from oxidizing. Cut the cherries in half and remove the stones [8], then pour them into the bowl, add the blueberries [9], and stir again.
Now turn to the strawberries, removing the stalks and slicing them thinly [10]. Add them to the rest of the fruit in the bowl and mix [11]. Next, move on to the figs: Wash them and cut off the stalks [12]. 
Then, without peeling them, cut them into wedges [13] and add them to the bowl before stirring gently once again. Now for the celery: Cut away the whitest, toughest part and peel the stick with a vegetable peeler. Next, cut the stem into small slices and cut the leafy part into larger pieces [14]. Add the stick and the leaves to the rest of the fruit [15].
Mix all of the ingredients well [16] and add the peanuts [17]. Give it one last stir and transfer your fruit salad into serving bowls [18] or serve straight from the bowl. Your fruit salad is ready to be enjoyed!
