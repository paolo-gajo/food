To prepare the batter, first separate the yolks from the egg whites [1]. Then beat them stiff using an electric mixer (2-3).
Set the egg whites aside for a moment and take the yolks. Add a pinch of salt [4] and milk [5], mixing with a whisk, or with the mixer at the lowest speed [6].
Next, sift the flour directly into the bowl [7] and mix again with a whisk [8] to obtain a homogeneous mixture [9].
Now add the egg whites beaten stiff [10] and fold them in with a spatula, mixing gently from bottom to top [11]. As soon as the batter is homogeneous and frothy [12], you can use it!
