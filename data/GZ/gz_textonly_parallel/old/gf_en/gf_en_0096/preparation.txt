To prepare the potato gnocchi, boil the potatoes for about 30-40 minutes [1] from the time they begin to bubble. The cooking time will vary, depending on size. Peel them while still hot and then immediately mash them into the flour that you have tipped onto the pastry board [2]. Add the egg [3] and a pinch of salt, 
then knead with your hands [4] to achieve a soft but compact dough [5]. Tear off a portion of dough and roll it out with your fingertips into one inch (2 cm) thick rolls. Your work will be easier if you sprinkle remilled semolina onto the work surface from time to time. Cut the gnocchi [6] 
and roll them over the gnocchi board to achieve the characteristic ridged look [7]. As you shape the potato gnocchi, arrange them on a tray lined with a lightly floured cloth, spaced well apart [8]. Now make the sauce: Slice the taleggio cheese [9], 
chop the rosemary leaves [10] and set to one side. Pour the fresh cream into a large saucepan, flavor with nutmeg [11], add the taleggio cheese to the pan [12] and allow it to melt over low heat, whisking at the same time.
As soon as the taleggio cheese has melted, thicken the sauce over a low heat so that it is not too runny, then remove from the heat [13]. Cut the speck into medium slices, slice into strips and then roughly cut into cubes [14]. Heat the speck with the chopped rosemary [15] 
and saut√© until crispy [16], then set aside. Chop the walnuts coarsely [17] and toast them in the saucepan you used to fry the speck [18] so that they absorb the aroma.
Cook the gnocchi in boiling salted water [19]. As soon as they bob to the surface, drain them into the pan with the taleggio cheese sauce [20]. If necessary, add a ladleful of the gnocchi cooking water and mix everything over low heat. Add the speck [21] 
and the walnuts [22], add salt if necessary, and season with black pepper [23]. Serve your gnocchi piping hot. Buon appetito [24]!
