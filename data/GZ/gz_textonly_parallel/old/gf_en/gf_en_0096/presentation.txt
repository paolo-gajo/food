You’ll need to roll up your sleeves like any self-respecting Italian nonna to prepare this dish. It’s an even more tempting and appetizing version of a quintessential home-cooked recipe that’s usually reserved for a special occasion: gnocchi with speck and walnuts. Use a special gnocchi board or simply the prongs of a fork… it will still taste the same and a slightly misshapen look will add to the homespun charm! Because these soft morsels cry out for tasty seasonings such as ragu or four-cheese sauces, we have accompanied the gnocchi with a creamy sauce containing taleggio cheese plus a good sprinkling of crispy speck and walnuts that will add character to the dish. Let yourself be lured by our appetizing recipe and find out the different ways you can prepare gnocchi. All the sauces are creamy and tasty, such as our version with stracchino cheese and spinach!
