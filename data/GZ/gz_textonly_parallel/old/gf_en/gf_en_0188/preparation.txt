To prepare the crème brûlée, first pour the milk and cream into a saucepan [1], add the vanilla bean and seeds [2]. Bring it gently to a boil. Meanwhile, put the yolks in a bowl with the sugar [3].
Gently mix the yolks with a whisk (or wooden ladle), making sure not to beat them to make them frothy [4]. When the milk and cream mixture has come to a boil, remove the vanilla bean, and pour the mixture little by little into the bowl with the yolks [5], stirring continuously to obtain a homogeneous mixture [6]. It will be very runny.
Place 6 ramekins with a capacity of 2/3 cup (150 ml) in a high-sided baking tray. Fill the cocottes with the mixture, which you have previously filtered with a strainer [7]. Pour boiling water into the pan until it covers one-third of the height of the ramekin [8], to bake the cream in a bain-marie. Cook in a static oven preheated to 285° F (140° C) for about 70 minutes, until the surface is golden brown and compact [9].
Once the ramekins are out of the oven, sprinkle the surface with sugar [10] and use a blowtorch to obtain a crunchy, caramelized crust [11]. Alternatively, you can put the ramekins in the oven under the grill for a few minutes. Your crème brûlée is ready to be enjoyed [12]!
