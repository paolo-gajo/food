To make the vegetarian stuffed peppers, first put the potatoes on to boil [1]. They’ll take around 30-40 minutes depending on how big they are (you can check the doneness by piercing them with a fork) and then allow to cool. In the meantime, you can start preparing everything else. Wash and dry the bell peppers: You’ll need 4 large peppers, around 2 lbs (850 g) in total; they may be red, yellow, and/or green peppers. Cut them across the top, around 1 inch (2 cm) from the end [2], leaving the stem in place, to create a sort of cup with a lid. Using a small knife, remove the parts with the seeds [3] in the bottom part of the peppers, 
as well as the inner strands [4]. Do this for all the peppers and then set aside. Trim the zucchini [5] and grate them using a coarse grater [6] to get a kind of fine julienne. 
Then grate the scamorza [7] and wash and cut the cherry tomatoes into quarters [8]; if they’re too small, just cut them in half. Rice the potatoes while they’re still warm [9], 
add the cherry tomatoes [10], the grated zucchini [11], and nearly all of the scamorza [12]; you’ll only need a little left over to put on top of the peppers before they go in the oven. 
Stir everything with a wooden spoon [13], then season with salt, add the thyme leaves [14], and season with pepper [15]. 
Stir everything again until you get an even mixture [16]. Next, arrange the peppers in a baking dish, remove the lids [17] for the time being, and fill them with the potato mixture [18]. 
Sprinkle with the scamorza you set aside before [19], put the lids back on the peppers, dress with a splash of oil [20], and cook them in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 40 minutes. When they’re done cooking, take them out of the oven and serve your vegetarian stuffed peppers [21].
