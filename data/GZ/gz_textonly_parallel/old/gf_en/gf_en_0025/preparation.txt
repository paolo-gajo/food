To prepare the frittata, crack the eggs and place them in a large bowl [1], then beat them lightly with a fork (or whisk) [2]. Pour in the grated Parmesan and Pecorino cheese [3], then add salt and pepper to taste.
Place a 12-inch (30 cm) non-stick pan over the heat and heat the oil for a few moments [4]. Add the beaten eggs [5] and let them cook over low heat for 8 minutes, covering the pan with a flat lid [6]; move the pan occasionally to keep the frittata from sticking to the bottom.
Once the required time has elapsed, flip the frittata: place the serving plate on the pan [7] and turn it upside down, keeping the plate and pan tightly together so that the frittata does not slip out: now you will find yourself with the cooked part of the frittata facing upwards, so slide the frittata inside the pan [8], so that the other side can cook for another 8 minutes, this time without the lid. Once ready, serve the frittata hot [9].
