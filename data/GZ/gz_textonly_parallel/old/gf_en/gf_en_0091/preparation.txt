To prepare the Mediterranean pasta salad, start by washing the cherry tomatoes and cutting them into small pieces [1]. Slice the pitted olives into rounds [2] and cut the buffalo mozzarella into cubes, then place in a strainer to drain off any excess liquid [3].
In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the bow tie pasta [4]. Now go back to the dressing: Put the tuna with its oil [5] in a large bowl and break up into small pieces using the prongs of a fork [6].
Add the chopped cherry tomatoes [7] and torn basil leaves [8] to the bowl with the tuna. Stir well to blend all the flavors [9].
Drain the pasta [10] and transfer to the bowl with the dressing [11]. Add the black olives [12] 
and mozzarella, minus its excess liquid [13]. Mix well and, if you prefer, season with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil [14] and a pinch of salt and pepper. Let your Mediterranean pasta salad rest for at least half an hour before serving [15]!
