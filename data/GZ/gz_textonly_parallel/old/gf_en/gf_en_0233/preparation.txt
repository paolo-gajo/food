To make the chocolate salami, first chop the chocolate with a knife [1]. Melt it in a bain-marie [2] and, once it has completely melted, let it cool.
In the meantime, place the chopped butter in a bowl at room temperature (it must still be malleable) and whip it with the sugar using a hand mixer (4-5). Flavor with rum [6].
Pour the lightly beaten eggs one at a time, continuing to beat with electric whisks [7] until the mixture is clear and frothy [8]. Now pour in the melted chocolate at room temperature [9].
Continue stirring until the chocolate is well mixed [10]. Now take the cookies and coarsely crumble them with your hands into a bowl [11], then add them to the chocolate [12],
and stir to mix together [13]. Transfer the dough to a sheet of baking paper [14], use the spatula to distribute the dough in a sausage shape [15].
Lift one of the two ends of the sheet, bring it towards the center and roll the salami (16-17) until it is completely wrapped with baking paper [18].
Fold the two side paper flaps [19] so that the salami is tightly closed. Place the salami on a tray and [20] leave it in the fridge to harden overnight. Once the chocolate salami has hardened, you can tie it with twine and sprinkle with powdered sugar [21].
