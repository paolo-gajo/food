To make Sicilian-style chicken, wash and dry the cherry tomatoes, then cut them in half [1] and set them aside. Remove the center of the chili peppers, cut them to extract the seeds [2], then slice them thinly [3].
Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the two garlic cloves [4] and chili peppers [5] and brown for a couple of minutes, then add the chicken [6].
Brown the chicken pieces 2-3 minutes per side over medium heat, then pour in the cherry tomatoes [7], olives [8], and capers [9],
then add the wild fennel [10]. Blend with wine [11], let it evaporate, then pour in the water [12].
Cover the pan with a lid [13] and continue cooking for 25 minutes over low heat. Then, add the remaining fennel and continue cooking without the lid for 15-20 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. After cooking, remove the garlic cloves and adjust the salt if necessary [14]. Serve your Sicilian-style chicken hot [15].
