Firm and shiny black olives, savory Pantelleria capers, juicy Pachino tomatoes and fragrant sprigs of wild fennel are the Mediterranean flavors found in the Sicilian-style chicken, a sincere second course you will love for its genuine simplicity. A touch of fresh chili pepper lends itself to the strong and proud character of this dish, and its rustic appearance evokes the lavish lunches of a bygone era, when bringing meat to the table was a privilege to be reserved for important occasions, and the dish was enriched only by the smells and aromas of its land of origin. The succulent sauce accompanying yourÂ Sicilian-style chicken recalls the famous "agghiotta" of Sicilian-style swordfish, a fresh and equally appetizing seafood dish. To taste the delicious sauce at its best, don't forget to accompany the dish with some fragrant bread rolls: use it to soak up the last drops!
