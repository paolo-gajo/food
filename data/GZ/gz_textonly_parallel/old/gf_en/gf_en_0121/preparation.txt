To make spaghetti frittata, first place a pan full of salted, it will be used to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, make the filling: dice the smoked bacon [1] and scamorza cheese [2]. As soon as the water boils, pour in the spaghetti and cook them until very firm to the bite [3].
Pour the eggs into a large bowl, add the thyme leaves [4] and milk [5], then salt and pepper [6].
Season with grated cheese [7] and mix well to obtain a homogeneous mixture [8]. Incorporate the filling [9] and stir again.
As soon as the pasta is cooked, drain it in a bowl and season it with a drizzle of olive oil [10]. Add the pasta to the filling [11] and stir again to blend. Take a flared round pan (we used one measuring 12 inches (30 cm) at the top and 10 inches (26 cm) at the bottom). Brown a clove of garlic in oil [12].
Remove the garlic clove and pour in the spaghetti [13]. Distribute them evenly with a spatula [14], then cook over a high heat for 1 minute so that the base hardens, then lower the heat, cover with the lid and cook for 15 minutes [15].
It's time to turn the frittata: shake the pan to make sure it is detached from the bottom, place a plate of the diameter of your pan [16] on top of the frittata, turn the pan upside down [17] and cook uncovered for another 5 minutes. The frittata is ready [18], enjoy it sliced warm or cold!
