Apulia is famous for its beautiful beaches and the fresh fish catches landed every morning on the harborsides of its towns and villages, along with mussels, sea urchins, and a host of other seafood delicacies. Although restaurants often prefer to serve raw fish, fried mussels is a traditional seafood appetizer that deserves a place on any menu. Most recipes for mussels involve opening the shellfish by cooking, as is the case with impepata di cozze (peppered mussels). But to make fried mussels, you must first open them, then stuff them, and finally fry them… only in this way will they stay tender and release all their wonderful flavor! Fried mussels are perfect to serve as an appetizer while still steaming hot, but they are also delicious at room temperature and you can use them as part of an authentic Apulian spread.
