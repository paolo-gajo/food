Sometimes it only takes a few moves to turn a simple ingredient into an impressive dish... and crunchy salmon is proof! All you have to do is get some good quality fresh fish fillets, season them with a fragrant herb-scented breading and bake them in the oven: the crunchy salmon will be cooked and golden to perfection. Accompany it with a light seasonal side dish, such as cress or chicory, within 30 minutes you can present a main course with seafood that will make you want to lick your lips!
