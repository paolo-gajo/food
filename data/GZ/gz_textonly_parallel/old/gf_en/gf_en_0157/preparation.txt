To make the crunchy salmon, first prepare the breadcrumbs: cut the bread into pieces and put it in a mixer [1], then add the dill [2] and thyme leaves [3],
rosemary [4] and parsley [5]. Pour in the oil [6],
then add the lemon zest [7], salt and white pepper [8]. Blend to a coarse consistency [9].
Now prepare the salmon fillets: remove the skin with a thin-bladed knife [10] and remove the bones with the help of kitchen pliers [11], then transfer the fillets to a drip pan lined with baking paper, and cover them with breadcrumbs, ensuring they stick well with your hands [12].
After covering the fillets evenly [13], bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 375° F (190° C) for about 20 minutes. After the cooking time has elapsed, take out of the oven [14] and serve your crunchy salmon very hot [15]!
