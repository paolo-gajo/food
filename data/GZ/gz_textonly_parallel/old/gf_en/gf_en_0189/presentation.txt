It’s undoubtedly the best-loved dessert in Italy; a firm fixture on restaurant dessert menus but also a perennial favorite among treats to make at home. It’s been reinterpreted and we’ve always had fun experimenting with an array of delicious alternatives: lemon, orange, and strawberry – in the classic version or egg-free! It comes with fruity variations and even with cardamom for lovers of a more exotic touch. There’s even a vegan recipe to ensure that no one is excluded from this dessert fest. Riding this imaginative tide, today we’re bringing you wild berry tiramisu, served in elegant single-portion dessert glasses, and made with fresh red berries and a silky-smooth cream you can whip up in a flash. These spoonfuls of sweetness will be your trump card to finish off a fun evening with friends!
