To make the wild berry tiramisu, first wash the berries and dry them. Remove the stalks from the strawberries [1] and cut them into small pieces [2]. Add the chopped raspberries [3]
and strawberries [4] to the jug of an immersion blender. Then add the brown sugar [5] and lemon juice [6]. 
Next, blitz everything with the blender [7] to get a smooth mixture. Sweeten the mixture with honey [8] and add the seeds of half a vanilla bean [9]. 
Now emulsify the mixture again with the blender [10]. Set aside the mixture [11] and cut the ladyfingers in half [12].
Pour the heavy cream into a bowl, add the powdered sugar [13], and whip with the whisk to get a frothy cream [14]. Separately, add the vanilla seeds [15]
to the mascarpone so they impart their flavor, then fold in the whipped cream a little at a time, stirring gently from the bottom up to keep it from curdling [16]. Transfer the resulting creamy mixture to a pastry bag (17-18).
Squeeze a first layer of the mixture into glasses measuring 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter and approximately 2.5 inches (6.5 cm) tall [19]. Dip a ladyfinger cut in half in the red berry coulis [20], place it in the glass and add one more layer of cream [21].
Now squeeze on more mixture and add 4-5 raspberries [22]. Add another layer of ladyfingers [23] and finish with a final layer of mixture [24].
Top your wild berry tiramisu with a few teaspoonfuls of leftover sauce [25] and finish by garnishing with a few berries to taste [26] as well as fresh mint leaves [27].
