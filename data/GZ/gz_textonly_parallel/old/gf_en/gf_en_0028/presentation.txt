Sicilian cuisine has its roots in simple food, based mainly on typical ingredients such as eggplant, tomatoes and basil, which are the undisputed stars of caponata (eggplant salad), the delicious side dish that we present today. These ingredients, already shared by other typical recipes such as pasta alla Norma (pasta with eggplant) and parmigiana (eggplant parmesan), create a mix of scents, colors and flavors that recall the stunning island of Sicily. Due to the extensive size of Sicily, caponata comes in many variations. Every province, actually every family has its own perfect recipe: with or without raisins, with or without tomato paste... moving just a few miles in another direction will reveal yet a different recipe for this distinctive dish, though all share the basic characteristics: a sweet-and-sour condiment, which gives the vegetables a unique flavor. Our advice? Try as many versions as you can, until you find your favorite that you can pass on to your family too!
