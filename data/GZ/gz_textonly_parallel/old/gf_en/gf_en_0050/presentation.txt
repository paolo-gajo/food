Stuffed vegetables are a summer dish that’s always loved and appreciated by everyone. There are endless variations, and we’ve tried almost all of them! Here are just a few examples:  rice-stuffed eggplant, Ligurian-style zucchini, stuffed friggitello peppers, meat-stuffed tomatoes... and then the one we’ve got for you today: vegetarian stuffed peppers! A real explosion of flavor, a riot of vegetables to savor either hot or at room temperature. Zucchini, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes along with scamorza cheese, become the ideal creamy and flavorful filling that combines perfectly with the soft shell of the bell peppers. Try your hand at these vegetarian stuffed peppers and serve them as part of a family lunch or dinner with friends, maybe alongside some other peppers stuffed with meat and sausage or rice!
