What is the typical Sunday dish? Itâ€™s difficult to choose one that everyone agrees on, each of us will remember our family's dishes because in the end that's what it's like, it's our roots that influence our cuisine. But after taking a virtual tour from North to South and exploring the many recipes of our tradition, from the typical Neapolitan ragu to the insurmountable lasagne, we came to an agreement when someone said the word "roast". There were some who proposed the one with milk, the larded one, or the one stuffed with plums. We opted for a classic one at the end, the juicy one accompanied by cubes of potatoes! Within an hour we were all at the table talking about how good and juicy roast veal with potatoes was. This is how we prepare it, a few ingredients, a time just right for cooking and the then your effort is repaid. Get ready to receive many compliments too: a roast like this is not only for Sundays, but for all the great occasions where you can end your meal with a fabulous soft pie with cream!
