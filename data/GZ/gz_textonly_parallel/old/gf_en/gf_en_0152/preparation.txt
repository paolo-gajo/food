To prepare the roast veal in with potatoes start with the latter. After washing and drying them well, peel them [1] and then cut them into cubes of about an inch or so; the most important thing is that they are all the same thickness [2]. Pour them into a bowl and add the oil, salt and pepper [3] and peeled garlic.
Add a sprig of chopped rosemary [4] and mix everything, with your hands or with a wooden spoon, [5] then transfer to a dripping pan greased with oil [6] and bake, in a preheated oven in static mode, at 400° F (200° C) for 20 minutes.
In the meantime, tie up the roast. First of all, remove the whitish tissues that could turn hard during cooking, making the meat tough. So with one hand you hold a raised flap of meat while with the other hand you use a sharp knife, the one for filleting fish will do [7], then keep trimming these parts until the piece of meat is completely clean [8]. Now you can tie it together. Unroll a large amount of kitchen string and place it underneath the meat lying horizontally on the cutting board [9].
Tie the two ends together with a double knot on the outer side: for convenience we start from the left to the end [10]. Now pass the string around your hand twice [11] (if you think you can, also rotate your hand so the string automatically knots), until it forms a loop [12].
Then put the meat inside [13] and tighten the string by pulling the upper or lower end until it reaches the center [14]. This is the first knot, repeat until the piece of veal is completely wrapped: in the meantime, remember to leave about a half an inch of space between one knot and the other [15].
At the end [16], turn the meat over on the other side, keeping the ends still [17], and tie it all together with a double knot on the side opposite to the first one [18].
Splint the meat by passing the other sprig of rosemary under the knots [19] and then salt and pepper the cutting board [20]. Place the piece of meat on it and start massaging it, making the seasoning stick to all the parts [21].
Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the meat [22], leaving it sealed on all sides over a medium-high flame. Every minute or so, to turn it with tongs or wooden spoons [23] making sure that the meat browns well [24].
When all sides of the piece of meat are well sealed, steam with the white wine [25] and let it evaporate for a few moments, then turn off the stove [26]. Put the meat on the center of the drip pan by making space among the potatoes [27].
Sprinkle the piece of veal with the sauce [28] and insert a roast thermometer until it reaches the center of the meat. Continue cooking at 400° F (200° C) , until the meat thermometer reaches 150° F (65° C), approximately 35 minutes [29]. After your roast veal with potatoes is done: wait a few minutes before removing the string and slicing this treat [30]!
