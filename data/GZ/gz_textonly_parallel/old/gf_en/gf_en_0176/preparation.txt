To prepare veal stew with potatoes start by washing and peeling the carrot, onion and celery, then chop them for soffritto (1-2). Take the veal meat, remove any connective tissue, i.e. the white translucent parts that could make the meat hard after cooking and cut it first into slices and then into pieces [3].
Take a large saucepan with high sides, heat the olive oil [4], add the chopped mixture for soffritto [5], season for 5 minutes over moderate heat, then add the veal chunks,
season with salt [7] and pepper [8] to taste and brown the meat for 4-5 minutes. Now sprinkle with the previously sifted flour [9], mixing it well in the cooking liquid to avoid lumps. 
Once the flour has been absorbed, add the white wine to the stew [10], let it evaporate completely, then add the meat stock to cover [11]. Season with the sprigs of aromatic herbs [12] previously tied together (bouquet garni), so they can be easily removed from the pan.
Cover the stew with a lid [13] and continue cooking for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. After this time, remove the aromatic herbs with kitchen tongs [14]. In the meantime, wash and peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes the size of the veal pieces [15].
Add the diced potatoes to the stew [16]. Continue cooking for another hour with the lid on, stirring occasionally until the potatoes and veal are tender [17]. Serve the veal stew with potatoes hot [18].
