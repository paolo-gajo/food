To prepare your quick and easy potato bombs, first boil the potatoes in plenty of cold water [1], which should take around 20 minutes. Once cooked, leave them to cool and remove the skins [2]. Pour the flour into a large bowl, then mash the potatoes directly in the same bowl [3].
While you start to knead with your hands, add in the baking powder [4], the egg [5], and a generous pinch of fine salt. Continue to knead until the mixture is consistent [6],
then transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and continue working the dough to form a ball [7]. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave to rest at room temperature in a dry place for around 10-15 minutes [8]. In the meantime, take the smoked scamorza cheese, remove the rind, and cut into fairly small cubes [9].
Once the dough has rested, use a rolling pin to roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of around ¼ inch (0.5 cm) [10]. Take a food ring mold with a 3-inch (8-cm) diameter [11] and use it to cut a total of 16 discs from the dough [12].
Top 8 of the discs with half a slice of prosciutto, a teaspoon of diced scamorza cheese [13], and a few fresh oregano leaves [14], then cover with the remaining discs [15] 
and press the edges together firmly with your fingers to seal the filling and prevent it from leaking out when you fry the bombs [16]. Once you have stuffed and sealed all of the discs [17], pour the sunflower oil into a small pan and bring it to a temperature of 320°-340°F (160°-170°C). Using a skimmer [18], place one piece at a time in the oil and allow to cook for around 2-3 minutes on each side.
Once your potato bombs are golden brown on all sides, gently remove them from the oil [19] and place on a sheet of oil-absorbing paper to drain [20]. Finally, season with Maldon salt [21] and serve your quick and easy potato bombs piping hot!
