To prepare the cold pasta salad with salmon, start with the puréed vegetables. Wash the vegetables, then remove the top of the pepper [1], remove the strands and seeds from inside, and cut it into small pieces [2]. Cut the Camone tomatoes in half [3] and
do the same with the red onion, once peeled [4]. Pour everything into a food processor together with the basil, salt, pepper, and oil [5]. Blitz for a few seconds until you get a purée, then set aside [6]. Heat a pan full of water for cooking the bow tie pasta, and add salt once boiling.
In the meantime, move on to the salmon, first cutting it into strips [7] and then into cubes of around an inch (a couple of centimeters) [8]. Heat a little oil in a pan and add the salmon [9].
Let it sizzle over medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally and taking care not to let it flake. Once it’s nearly cooked, season with salt, and set aside to cool [10]. Finally, prepare the pasta. Place the bow ties in the salted boiling water [11], and as soon as they are cooked al dente, drain them and pour them into a bowl, dress with oil, and leave to cool [12].
Pour the puréed vegetables over the pasta [13], stir, and garnish with the grated lemon zest [14] and a few basil leaves [15].
Finally, add the salmon [16] and give it a final stir [17]. Leave to cool in the refrigerator for an hour or so before serving your cold pasta salad with salmon [18]!
