The hamburger is the most loved and imitated American dish in the world. Its traditional version includes beef and the inevitable pairing with French fries and delicious sauces. Alongside this timeless recipe, countless variations with fish have also appeared in addition to the vegetarian version, such as the one we offer here: the chickpea burger. It is a second course to prepare in just a few minutes, blending all the ingredients in the mixer. The result is a chickpea meatball with spicy notes of ginger and the pungent taste of mustard. And like all self-respecting burgers, these will taste even better in very soft burger buns with salad, tomatoes, and sauces... how will you serve it?
