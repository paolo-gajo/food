Angelica brioche with zucchini is a show-stopping soft, savory, leavened brioche. It is inspired by the iconic Italian Angelica cake recipe, which is stuffed with chocolate chips, and topped with a sweet glaze! In this savory version, the chocolate chips are replaced by soft zucchini, tasty caciocavallo cheese, and crunchy slivers of toasted almonds. The method and the final wreath construction are unchanged, and you will get the same show-stopping effect… a savory cake that is a feast for the eyes! Angelica brioche with zucchini is perfect to serve as an appetizer with pride of place on your table, or to take on a picnic: it is excellent whether eaten hot or at room temperature. Try it in our mignon version, or with beer!
