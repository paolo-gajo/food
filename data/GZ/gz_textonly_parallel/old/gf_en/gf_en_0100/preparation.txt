To prepare the fusilli pasta with pistachio pesto and cherry tomatoes, begin with the pesto: Take the shelled pistachios and blanch them in boiling water for 5 minutes [1], drain, and remove the dark skin [2]. Place the pistachios in a food processor and add oil [3].
Add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, the zest of half a lemon, half a clove of garlic, room-temperature water, salt and pepper, and the basil leaves [4]. Blitz until you get a smooth paste [5]. Now transfer the pistachio pesto to a bowl and set aside. In the meantime, boil the water for the pasta and add salt once itâ€™s reached a boil. Then move on to the leek: Remove the root part [6].
Discard the tough outermost layer of the leek [7] and slice the rest into rounds [8]. Fry the leek in a pan with a little oil [9].
To keep the leek from burning, add hot water directly from the pasta pot to the pan [10] and let it stew. Wash the cherry tomatoes under running water and cut them into quarters [11], then add to the leek [12].
Season with salt and pepper [13] and cover the pan with a lid [14]. Leave everything to cook over moderate heat for 10 minutes. The cherry tomatoes will break down to form a sauce. Add salt to the pasta water and bring it to a boil: Pour in the fusilli and cook for the time stated on the package [15].
By now, the sauce will be ready: Turn off the heat and add the pistachio pesto [16], stir [17], and pour over a ladleful of the pasta cooking water to combine everything well [18].
Drain the fusilli and pour into the pan with the sauce [19], then turn up the heat for a few moments as you coat everything in the sauce [20]. Serve your fusilli pasta with pistachio pesto and cherry tomatoes [21]!
