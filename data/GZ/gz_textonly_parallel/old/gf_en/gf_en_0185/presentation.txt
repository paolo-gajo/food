A leavened brioche braid is a sweet bread made using fresh brewer’s yeast. It’s perfect for breakfast but also great as a snack. This brioche braid will keep the whole family happy! It isn’t difficult to make at home: We used a planetary mixer as an easy way to get a smooth, soft dough, but you can also knead the dough by hand and get excellent results! Have fun making it with your kids – they’ll go crazy for the nib sugar on top, but you can also decorate it with raisins or chocolate chips. Enjoy it as is, with a cup of hot chocolate, coffee, or a cappuccino. Or, why not toast the slices and spread some Nutella or jelly on them?
