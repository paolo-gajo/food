To prepare paccheri (pasta sleeves) carbonara with artichokes, first clean the artichokes: remove the harder outer leaves [1] and the central fuzz, cut them in half [2], then into quarters and finally into thin strips [3]. As you cut them, put the artichokes in a bowl of water with lemon juice to prevent them from blackening.
Peel and finely chop the shallot, then heat a pot of water that will be used to cook the pasta. Pour the oil into a pan, add the chopped shallot [4] and brown over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Add the diced bacon [5], turn up the heat and brown for 2-3 minutes, then simmer with white wine [6] until reduced.
Now add the artichokes, drained from the water and lemon juice [7], and salt. Pour a ladle of hot water into the pan [8], lower the heat slightly and leave to cook for 10-12 minutes until the artichokes have softened, stirring occasionally. When the water for the pasta has come to a boil, add salt and cook the paccheri pasta for the time indicated on the package [9].
In the meantime, pour the yolks into a separate bowl, add the grated Parmesan [10] and Pecorino cheese and freshly ground pepper to taste [11], then stir with a whisk to mix well and obtain a rather thick cream [12]; if necessary, you can add half a ladle of the cooking water from the pasta.
When the paccheri pasta is ready, pour it into the frying pan with the seasoning [13], stir over moderate heat and let it absorb the flavors briefly, then turn off the heat and pour the egg mixture into the pan [14]. Mix well and serve your paccheri carbonara with artichokes [15]!
