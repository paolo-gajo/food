Totani, or European squid, are sometimes considered the poor man’s calamari, and the two are, in fact, often confused, but we know exactly how they differ in terms of shape and color, among other things. When it comes to using them for cooking, however, the two are pretty much interchangeable. So, following on from our delicious stuffed calamari recipe, we thought we’d put together a recipe for stuffing their marine cousins, too, giving us today’s recipe for totani ripieni – baked stuffed squid. An appetizing combination of potatoes, soaked bread, and fresh turmeric makes the perfect hearty, soft filling for the squid, accompanied by the freshness of a yogurt cream to give this fish main course that extra dimension!
