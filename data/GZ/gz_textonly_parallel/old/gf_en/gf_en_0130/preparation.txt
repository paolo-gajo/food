To prepare the stuffed squid, start with the potatoes. Place them in a saucepan with cold water and cook for around 20-30 minutes from boiling (you can speed up the cooking process by using a pressure cooker)[1]. Once they’re ready (make sure they can be pierced easily with a fork), allow them to cool, then peel and set aside. Next, remove the crust from the bread, cut the bread into chunks [2], and soak the chunks in the milk [3].
Clean the squid by removing the head (4-5) and the side “wings” with a knife. Rinse the squid thoroughly, both outside and inside [6], to remove any impurities.
Chop up the wings and the tentacles [7], and finely chop the scallion, having removed the green part and the roots beforehand, along with the marjoram leaves [8]. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pan, add the chopped scallion and marjoram [9], and fry over low heat, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes.
Then add the chopped wings and tentacles [10] and cook over high heat for a few moments [11], ensuring that the water released from the squid evaporates completely [12].
At this point, you need to start preparing the filling. Mash the now-cold potatoes in a large bowl [13] and add the soaked bread [14], the chopped squid and scallion [15],
the grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [16], the peeled fresh turmeric grating it directly into the bowl [17], the salt, the pepper, and the whole egg [18]. 
Mix thoroughly [19], and once all of the ingredients are combined, transfer the mixture to a disposable pastry bag [20]. Preheat a conventional oven to 350°F (180°C), then grease the bottom of a small baking dish (that will hold 4 stuffed squid), stuff the squid to the top with the filling [21], 
and lay them side by side in the dish [22]. Season with salt and pepper to taste [23] and finish with a drizzle of oil. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for approximately 30 minutes. While the squid are baking, turn your attention to the accompanying sauce. Pour the yogurt and cream into a small bowl, add a drizzle of oil [24]
and the dill [25], and mix well. Once the squid are cooked, take them out of the oven [26] and serve each baked stuffed squid with the accompanying sauce [27].
