To prepare the pastiera, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry dough. On a work surface, sift the flour [1] and add a pinch of salt [2] to form a volcano, making sure you can see the work surface underneath in the center [3].
In the center add butter, lard [4], and sugar [5]. Mix these 3 ingredients well by hand [6].
Continue to mix and add the honey [7], egg, milk [8], and citrus peels [9].
Continue to mix the ingredients in the center of the flour [10] until you obtain a kind of soft batter [11]. Then begin to add the flour slowly [12] and mix with the help of a dough scraper if needed.
Shape the dough into a ball [13]. To make it more homogeneous, you can lightly dust the work surface with a little flour. Then continue to knead the dough to make it completely smooth and homogeneous [14]. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour [15].
While the dough is resting, prepare the wheat cream. Pour the precooked wheat in a pan and add a pinch of salt [16]. Mash the wheat a little to make it uniform and pour in the milk [17] and add the butter [18].
You can also add a piece of orange and lemon peel [19]. Bring it to the verge of boiling which will take just a few minutes. Use a fork to mash the wheat as it cooks and continue to stir [20]. Once it is about to boil, turn off the heat and transfer the wheat mixture to a low and wide pan to cool [21].
In a separate bowl, add the drained ricotta [22] cheese and the sugar [23]. Stir until you obtain a soft cream and then let it rest in the refrigerator for about an hour [24].
After the time has elapsed, take out the cold wheat mixture from the refrigerator, remove the citrus peels [25] and place the wheat mixture in a large bowl. Add the diced candied citron [26] and stir briefly. At this point, if you want, you can use a hand blender for a few seconds to obtain a mixture with a less rustic consistency [27].
Take the bowl with the ricotta cheese and sugar, add the honey [28], stir, and add the wheat mixture, stirring constantly to combine the ingredients [29]. In another bowl, add the eggs, yolk, and orange blossom water [30].
Then add the milk [31], zest a little bit of lemon and orange [32], and mix everything well [33].
Add this mixture to the ricotta cheese and wheat cream in two or three parts and continue to mix. The filling is now ready [34]. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and divide it into two parts, one larger than the other [35]. Roll out the larger part on a work surface with a rolling pin, making sure they are both lightly floured [36], until you obtain a thickness of 1/8 inch (3 mm). Then roll the dough around the rolling pin.
Unroll it over an 8-inch (20 cm) flared pastiera cake mold (no need to grease and flour) [37]. Let it adhere well to the bottom and sides, then remove the excess dough by passing the rolling pin over the edges [38]. Trim with a small knife [39] and prick the base with a fork.
Place the filling inside, gently beat the mold on the work surface to eliminate any air bubbles [40]. Roll out the remaining dough and make seven ½-inch (1-2 cm) [41] thick strips. Place the first 4 strips over the filling reaching over the edge of the pastiera mold in a diagonal direction. Then add on top of the 4 strips the other 3, again reaching over the edges, to create a grid pattern. Then eliminate the excess dough [42]. The pastiera is now ready to be baked in a preheated static oven at 360° F (180° C) for about 50-55 minutes on the lowest rack.
Then take the Neapolitan pastiera out of the oven [43] and when it has completely cooled you can either remove it from the mold or serve the cake directly in it [44]. Sprinkle a little powdered sugar just before serving and enjoy [45]!
