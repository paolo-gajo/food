At Easter, in particular on Holy Thursday before Easter, in Neapolitan kitchens there is the traditional preparation of the Neapolitan pastiera. It is a genuine ritual made up of gestures and secrets that are handed down from one generation to the next. Each family has its own way of preparing the perfect dough, of flavoring the filling with wheat cream and ricotta cheese (either with sheep’s milk or sheep’s and cow’s milk), and of deciding the thickness and number of decorative strips. We invite you to discover the recipe of pastry chef Stefano Avellano from the historic Gran Caffè Gambrinus of Naples. You will enjoy its incredible taste and aromas, an explosion of flavors... pure poetry. Behind this one-of-a-kind dessert, which is the pride of Naples and indeed of a whole territory, are many hidden legends and historical curiosities. Remember to be patient when preparing this typical Easter cake, because the more your Neapolitan pastiera rests, the better it will taste!
