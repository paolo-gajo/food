To prepare milk bread, first melt the butter over low heat and let it cool. Pour the two sieved flours [1] into a bowl, add the sugar [2] and yeast [3].
Then pour the milk at room temperature [4], start mixing with a dough cutter to blend the ingredients [5], then continue by hand and as soon as you have a homogeneous mixture, you can add the melted butter [6].
Knead again by hand to incorporate the butter and finally add the salt [7]. Knead again in the bowl [8], then move to the slightly oiled work surface and handle the dough for about 15 minutes until it is smooth and elastic [9].
Twirl it to obtain a spherical shape [10]. Place it in a lightly buttered bowl [11] and let it rest for about 2 hours in a cold oven with just the light on or in a place away from drafts, covered with plastic wrap [12].
Once the rising time has elapsed, your dough will have increased in volume [13]. Place it on the worktop [14] and handle it briefly to obtain two sticks. Divide them in half lengthwise [15].
Divide them into about 30 chunks, approximately 1 oz each [16] [17]. To form the rolls you can pull each chunk of dough and give it an elliptical shape [18].
Lightly dust your fingers with flour to tuck all the edges under the center [19] [20], then rotate them [21].
Slightly pinch the base to seal, and you have your first roll [22]. Place the milk rolls on a drip pan lined with baking paper [23]. Mix egg and milk in a bowl [24].
Brush the rolls [25] and leave to rise for about 30 minutes. Once risen, bake your milk bread in a static oven preheated to 400°F (200°C) for about 12-13 minutes. Once cooked [26], place them on a grill to let them cool [27] before serving with sweet fillings such as jams, marmalade and sweet creams or with cold cuts and cheeses!
