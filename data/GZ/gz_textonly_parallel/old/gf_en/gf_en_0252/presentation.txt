They are perfect for a simple, genuine afternoon snack at home, but also great for a break outside with a checkered tablecloth and some juice. Milk rolls are one of the easiest ways to make everyone happy: these little bread buns are made by kneading flour, butter and milk by hand. They are very easy to prepare and perfect with jams, marmalade and spreads but also to accompany cold cuts and cheeses and enrich the bread basket. If stored properly, milk breadÂ stays fresh for a few days. But we're sure you won't stop at one and in no time you'll be back to the kneading table.
