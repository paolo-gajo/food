To prepare the lingue di gatto cookies, first place the softened butter in a bowl. Add the powdered sugar [1] and stir with a spatula. These ingredients will not have to be whipped. Add the egg whites [2] and stir again until a cream is obtained [3].
Add flour [4] and stir again until soft [5]. Place the mixture into a pastry bag with a smooth 2/3 inch (10 mm) nozzle [6].
Prepare sticks about 4 inches (10 cm) long [7] on an oven baking tray [8] lined with baking paper; you can fit about 15 on the same tray. Cook in a preheated ventilated oven at 375° F (190° C) for about 8 minutes. At this point the cookies will be ready. Remove them from the oven [9] 
and if you prefer to give them a different shape than usual, use a rolling pin when they are still hot [10] and then let them cool. This way you will get curved cookies. Otherwise, to obtain a straight shape, just let them cool in the tray. Transfer to a serving plate and serve [11]or use them to make a dessert and let your imagination run wild [12].
