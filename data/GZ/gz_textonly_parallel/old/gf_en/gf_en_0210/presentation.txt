We commonly know them as lingue di gatto, or cat tongues, because of their flat, narrow and elongated shape. The technical term in pastry making for these delicious, easy-to-make cookies is massa a sigaretta, pirouettes, or rolled wafer cookies, as explained by Maestro Iginio Massari, who made them for us. We have all tasted them at least once, hidden among the other cookies and pastries in the group of Sunday pastries. They are made in just a few minutes, with a delicate dough prepared with butter, sugar, flour, and egg whites. They are ideal served as a snack together with small pastries, as they perfectly pair with tea or ice cream, soft desserts, mouth-watering creams, and fruit salads. Lingue di gatto cookies can also be used to garnish cakes, adding an extra touch of elegance and indulgence!
