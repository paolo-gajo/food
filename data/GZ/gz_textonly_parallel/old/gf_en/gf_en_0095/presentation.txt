Everyone knows the two classic cannelloni dishes: traditional cannelloni with a meat filling and the healthier cheese and spinach version. Today we suggest another vegetarian alternative that will whet the appetite of even diehard traditionalists, cannelloni with eggplant! The ingredients include some fundamental building blocks of Italian cuisine, namely fresh egg pasta, tomato sauce with basil, and b√©chamel sauce. This iconic trio is combined with a soft filling of eggplant and melted mozzarella cheese. The result has a simple flavor that is also hearty and succulent. It deserves pride of place at the most lavish Italian lunch but would go down well at any time. Because cannelloni with eggplant are ideal for preparing in advance, this dish could be a practical solution to cook ahead for weekdays.
