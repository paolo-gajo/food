To prepare Ligurian-style stuffed zucchini, first wash the zucchini and boil them according to their consistency: if they are firm, you can leave them in boiling water for about 6-7 minutes. If they are a bit soft, then you can reduce the time by 1-2 minutes [1]. Drain the zucchini and put them in a bowl with ice so they cool quickly without losing the beautiful bright green color [2]. When they are cold, remove the ends of the zucchini [3],
then cut them in half lengthwise [4] and empty them with a corer; set them aside for a moment [5]. In the meantime, cut the stale bread into cubes [6].
Pour it into a bowl and add the milk, then let it soften [7]. Clean and cut the onion first horizontally, and then vertically [8]. Then chop finely and move to the stove [9].
Heat the oil together with the onion and anchovies in a frying pan, let the anchovies melt, stirring often with a spatula, then add the zucchini pulp. Toss for a few minutes on high heat and transfer it to a bowl [11]. Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in another pan, ensuring that they do not burn [12].
Now that everything is ready, prepare the dough: in the blender pour the drained tuna, toasted pine nuts [13] and the washed capers [14]. Add the soaked bread [15]
and blend it all together until a homogeneous mixture is obtained [16]. Add the mixture to the base of onions, anchovies and zucchini [17]. Also add the grated Parmesan cheese [18],
the beaten eggs [19] and then season with salt, pepper [20] and thyme, then add the breadcrumbs and mix well with a spatula [21].
Grease a baking pan that can hold the zucchini [22] then stuff them with the mixture [23] and place them inside the baking pan [24].
Dust the surface with breadcrumbs [25] and bake in a preheated oven in grill mode at 480° F (250° C) for about 10-12 minutes [26]. Once cooked, wait 5 minutes before serving your Ligurian-style stuffed zucchini [27].
