Chocolate cake is a classic and timeless Italian dessert without milk which everyone always likes. Every moment is right to enjoy a slice: tall and soft, it's perfect for a snack, with tea, or in the morning to soak in milk for a special breakfast that will wake up even small children with its unmistakable aroma of cocoa! But this chocolate cake recipe is truly versatile, and to turn it into a more structured dessert, you just need to fill it with the cream you love and top with whipped cream, icing or berries. Make this cake for a party or perhaps as a basis for other original desserts (think for example how to transform it for Halloween): with a chocolate cake, you'll play it safe, and you just have to make it to be a success!
