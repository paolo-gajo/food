To make the eggless tiramisu, first make the coffee to soak the ladyfingers in using a moka pot. Whip the cream in a bowl using an electric beater [1], gradually add the powdered sugar [2] and continue until semi-whipped [3].
Once the cream is ready [4], add in the mascarpone a little at a time [5] and mix everything together gently but thoroughly [6].
Transfer the cream to a pastry bag without a nozzle [7] and start filling your glasses [8]. Spread a layer of cream on the bottom of each small glass to form the base [9].
Slice each ladyfinger biscuit in half [10], then pour the cooled ristretto coffee into a large container and quickly soak the ladyfingers [11]. Lay the biscuits on top of the layer of cream in each small glass [12].
Next, add another layer of cream [13], then sprinkle with unsweetened cocoa powder. Continue with another halved ladyfinger [14] and finish with a layer of cream [15].
Fill to the rim of the glass [16]. Repeat this process for all of the other glasses and sprinkle your eggless tiramisu with unsweetened cocoa [17] powder before serving [18].
