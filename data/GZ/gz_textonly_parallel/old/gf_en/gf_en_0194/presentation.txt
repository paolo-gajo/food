Flourless chocolate cake is a dessert with a unique consistency, as it stays compact – soft but at the same time dense and moist inside. It’s quick and easy to make, too: Just whip the butter with the sugar, add the eggs one at a time, stir in the other ingredients, the melted dark chocolate, and voilà, your cake is ready! This flourless chocolate cake is suitable for celiacs; just make sure to use gluten-free cocoa powder and powdered sugar. With its truly tempting taste, this is a chocolate cake recipe that’s really perfect for everyone!
