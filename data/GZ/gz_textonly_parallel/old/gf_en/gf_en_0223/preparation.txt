To make amor polenta, first prepare the butter and almond mix: put 1 tablespoon (12,g) of butter [1] and 2 tablepoons (13 g) of almond flour in a mixer [2]. Blend to obtain a homogeneous mixture [3] and set aside. Then melt 1/2 cup (125 g) of butter over very low heat and let cool.
Whip the egg together with the sugar in a large bowl with electric whisks [4], then continue to whip the egg yolks [5] and the seeds taken from the vanilla bean [6]. 
 Add the grated rind of an untreated lemon [7], salt [8], and the almond and butter mix [9].
Once you have whipped the mixture [10], move on to the dry ingredients: pour the almond flour, baking powder, corn flour and 00 flour [11] into a bowl, then sift it on a sheet of baking paper [12].
Add the sieved dry ingredients to the whipped mixture and incorporate them evenly [10]. Pour in the melted butter [14] and stir again gently to obtain a homogeneous and uniform mixture [15].
Now butter and flour a traditional 8x3 inch (20x7.5 cm) amor polenta mold and pour in the mixture [16]. Bake it in a static oven at 330° F (165° C) for 60 minutes. Once cooked, let it cool [17] before removing the mold, and sprinkle with powdered sugar: your amor polenta is ready to be enjoyed [18]!
