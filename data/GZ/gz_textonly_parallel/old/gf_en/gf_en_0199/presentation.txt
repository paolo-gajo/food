Imagine the lightness of a cloud. Chiffon cake will give you just this feeling: a soft, extremely light and delicate cake that melts in your mouth. The characteristic feature of this particular American dessert is its irresistible lightness and softness. You can enjoy it as is, like in this version, flavored with vanilla and lemon and sprinkled only with powdered sugar. But chiffon cake is also the ideal base for cakes of all kinds, filled as you like or covered with frosting. The great softness comes from adding cream of tartar to the whipped egg whites and from using a chiffon cake pan that allows air to escape and homogeneous cooling of the cake without it sagging. Served alone or with velvety creams, chiffon cake is a truly heavenly experience for the palate!
