To prepare the chiffon cake, start by sifting the flour in a bowl together with the baking powder [1]. Then add the superfine baker’s sugar [2] and salt [3]. Stir with a spoon to mix them well. 
In another bowl, separate the yolks from the egg whites of 6 large eggs [4], weighing about 14 oz in total (390-400 g), and keep the egg whites aside. Add water at room temperature [5] and the sunflower seed oil [6] to the yolks.
Then grate the rind of an untreated lemon [7] and cut a vanilla bean to extract the seeds with the tip of a small knife and add them to the egg yolk mixture [8]. Whisk the mixture until you get a homogeneous cream, there will be no need to whip it. Then mix it with the dry ingredients (flour, sugar and baking powder), adding all at once [9].
Whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy [10]. Leave this mixture aside for a moment and pour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer [11] (a hand mixer can be used as well), and then beat the egg whites. When they are white and frothy, pour in the cream of tartar [12] and keep mixing for a few minutes.
Once the egg whites have been beaten [13], add a part to the mixture kept aside [14] and stir quickly with a spatula to dilute the mixture. Then add the remaining egg whites a little at a time, continuously stirring with a spatula [15] from top to bottom so as not to deflate the egg whites.
Now that the cake dough is ready, pour it gently into the chiffon cake pan: we used a standard tube pan with an 8 1/2" (22 cm) diameter bottom, 10" (26 cm) surface diameter and 4" (10 cm) height (it should not be buttered and floured) [16], trying to distribute it evenly [17]. Then bake the chiffon cake in a static oven preheated to 325° F (160° C) for about 60 minutes (for a ventilated oven 300° F (150° C) for 45-50 minutes), placing the cake on the lower oven rack. Once baked, take it out of the oven [18].
Then turn the pan upside down and rest it on the special feet of the pan [19] so that the cake gets air, cools down and separates at the edges by itself. When the chiffon cake has completely cooled, remove the top of the pan using a thin, sharp knife [20]. Your chiffon cake is ready to be sprinkled with powdered sugar to taste [21]!
