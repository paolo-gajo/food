To prepare the omelettes, first break the eggs into a bowl [1]. Add the milk [2] and a pinch of salt [3]. 
Whisk together the eggs [4] and the milk [5] to blend thoroughly. They will be ready when the mixture falls off the whisk in a stream [6]. 
Heat a pan and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. As soon as it is hot, pour the egg mixture in the pan [7]; to see if the oil is hot enough, try pouring a few drops in first. Cook the omelette over medium-low heat: the egg will remain softer if cooked slowly. The outside should be golden, but not too much, as soon as it starts to set on the edges, cover it with a lid [8]. If the temperature seems to be too high, move the pan away from the heat for a few seconds, with the lid on. Swirl the pan gently to prevent the omelette from resting on the same spot for too long. As soon as the omelette is soft on the surface ("drooly") [9]
and when lifting the edge with a spatula the bottom is a golden color [10], fold the omelette in a crescent shape [11], leave it a few more seconds in the pan and serve your omelette hot [12]. Simple or accompanied by seasonal vegetables, it will make an excellent second course. With crispy bacon, it will help complete a perfect continental breakfast!
