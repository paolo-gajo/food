To make this pasta with stracchino, bresaola, and cherry tomatoes, first bring a pan of water to a boil before adding salt. Slice the bresaola [1] into strips and then into smaller pieces. Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters to form wedges (2-3).
Once the water is boiling, pour in the pasta [4] and cook for the time stated on the package. While the pasta is cooking, turn your attention to the sauce. Pour a little oil [5] and the stracchino cheese into a pan [6]. 
Heat up over low heat, and then add the milk for a looser consistency [7]. Stir to combine and, once the pasta is ready, drain and pour directly into the pan [8]. Saut√© the pasta to develop the flavor, then turn off the heat and add the bresaola [9],
the cherry tomatoes [10], and finally the washed and dried arugula [11]. Stir one last time and serve your pasta with stracchino, bresaola, and cherry tomatoes [12] immediately.
