It's a quiet afternoon and you're waiting for your guests to enjoy a good cup of tea together, all that's missing are some inviting baked goodies! S-shaped cookies, pastries and butter and jam cookies are a classic for these occasions, but not only... perfect for children's snacks or for a genuine breakfast, these morsels with a sweet center are ideal to enrich every moment of the day with their melting texture and intense flavor of orange marmalade. Quick and easy to prepare, they will leave you with time to enrich your tea tray with other small delicacies, such as spelt and orange biscuits, chocolate-covered coconut cookies, eggless biscuits, or soft lemon and orange cookies, so you can create a fragrant choice of shortbread to go with your favorite tea! If you want to delight your friends with a British-style welcome, butter and jam cookies are the right choice, even during the Christmas holidays! Make sure you make plenty of them: they'll disappear in a flash as you chat away!
