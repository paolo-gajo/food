To make the cheesy potato and zucchini balls, first boil the potatoes with the skins on for 30-40 minutes depending on their size. You’ll know when they’re done as they’ll be soft enough for the prongs of a fork [1] to slide in easily. Once they’re ready, press them through a potato ricer to form a purée [2]. You don’t need to peel them because the skins will stay in the ricer. Now, wash and dry the zucchini, then trim them and grate them using a fine grater [3]. Squeeze the zucchini well to get all the liquid out.
Place the potato purée and grated zucchini together in a bowl [4], stir to combine [5], and then add the flour [6],
the grated Parmigiano cheese [7], and the breadcrumbs [8]. Also add the egg [9], season with salt,
and mix together to form an even, fairly dense dough [10]. Now cut the provola cheese into cubes and set aside [11]. Wet your hands slightly and take a small portion of the dough about the size of a walnut, shape it into a ball, and then create an indentation [12] with your thumb. 
Place a cube of provola [13] in this indentation, then close up the ball by pressing gently with your fingers [14]. As you make the balls, arrange them in a baking dish [15].
Roll the balls in breadcrumbs [16] and arrange them on a tray [17]. Now they’re ready to be cooked: Heat the peanut oil in a pot, and once it’s reached 285°F (140°C) (check this using a food thermometer), immerse the balls a few at a time [18] (doing too many at once will cause the oil temperature to drop).
Cook the balls for 3 minutes or until they turn golden, then remove them from the oil using a skimmer [19] and arrange them on a tray lined with paper towel to absorb any excess oil [20]. Serve the cheesy potato and zucchini balls piping hot [21].
