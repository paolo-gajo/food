A good Sunday dish is one that brings family and friends together to enjoy a rich, tasty meal and one that also, in some cases, offers a nice, indulgent touch of abundance. There are 3 basic cornerstones of Sunday lunch: Lasagne, baked pasta, and, of course, the ever-popular gnocchi, eaten soft piping hot from the pot or given a quick au gratin crispy touch. It’s tough to choose, but today we’re going for a special take on the first option to make these lasagna rolls. These ricotta and spinach rolls are made with classic wavy lasagna sheets, the precursor to the lasagna we know today, made with water and remilled semolina flour and dating back to Roman times. This lasagna roll is the perfect Sunday dish as it gives a nod to ancient tradition while also offering a touch of modernity. What’s more, its single-portion format means you can combine the past with the future as you take your taste buds to a whole new world of flavor. Intrigued? Then let's get started!
