To prepare the stuffed tomatoes first wash the tomatoes, cut off the top and set aside [1]. With a small knife, cut the inner perimeter of the tomato and dig out the pulp with a teaspoon, collecting it in a bowl [2]. Pour the pulp into a mixer [3].
Blend the pulp to obtain a juice [4]. Place the tomatoes on a grill, salt them [5] and then turn them over to drain [6].
Now make the sauce: in a pan, heat the olive oil with garlic [7], then, when the oil is seasoned, remove the garlic [8] and pour in the pulp [9]. Cook for 20 minutes over medium heat to reduce.
In the meantime, cook the rice in boiling water [10]. When the pulp is almost cooked, add salt and pepper [11]. Chop the parsley and basil (well washed and dried) [12].
Remove the pan with the pulp from the heat once cooked, and flavor with chopped herbs [13]. Pour the resulting sauce into a bowl, add the rice [14] and season with grated Grana Padano cheese and Pecorino cheese [15].
Mix and set the filling aside [16]. Dice the scamorza cheese [17] and stuff the tomatoes, starting with a couple of tablespoons of rice [18].
Add 2 or 3 cubes of scamorza cheese, and fill up to and a little over the edge with another spoonful of rice [19]. The tomatoes are now ready to be cooked [20]. Place the caps on another baking tray [21] and cook them together with the stuffed tomatoes in a static oven preheated to 355° F (180° C) for about 50 minutes.
When cooked, the stuffed tomatoes will be golden brown on the surface [22], take them out of the oven together with the caps [23] and serve them hot together, garnished with basil leaves [24]!
