To make cannelloni, start making the egg pasta. Put the flour [1] and beaten eggs [2] in a large bowl. Start kneading with your hands [3] until you obtain a fairly uniform mixture.
Then transfer it to a work surface [4] and knead until you get a smooth dough that has a circular shape [5]. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for about an hour.
In the meantime, make a simple sauce: pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the garlic, let it brown, and pour in the tomato puree [7]. Season with salt, pepper [8], cover with a lid, and cook over moderate heat for about 30 minutes [9], stirring occasionally.
During this time, make the béchamel sauce: pour the butter into a pan [10] and let it melt. Then add the sieved flour [11] and stir quickly with a whisk. Once you have obtained a slightly brown roux, pour in the hot milk [12] and continue stirring.
Season with salt and pepper [13] and add a pinch of nutmeg [14]. Leave the béchamel to thicken, continue mixing, then pour it into a glass bowl and cover it with plastic wrap [15].
Now you can make the filling. Prepare the sauté by finely chopping celery, carrot, and onion [16]. Then transfer them to a pan with a drizzle of oil and add the minced meat [17]. Remove the skin from the sausage [18] and crumble it with your hands.
Then add the sausage to the saucepan [19] and let it brown, stirring frequently. Season with salt, pepper, and red wine only when the meat has changed colour [20]. Let cook for another ten minutes, then pour it all into a glass bowl. Once the meat has cooled, add the eggs [21]
and grated Parmesan cheese [22] and mix it all together [23]. The egg pasta will have rested enough at this point, so take the dough and divide it in half [24].
Then spread the two halves using a dough sheeter [25] up to a thickness of 8 [26], so as to obtain a thickness of about 1/10 inch (1-2 mm), then cut rectangles measuring 5 1/2 x 3 1/2 inches (14 X 9 cm) [27].
Blanch one rectangle of pasta at a time for 1 minute in plenty of salted boiling water [28] and transfer them to a tray, on a clean cloth [29]; if you prefer, you can dip them in cold water for a moment so as to stop them from cooking, but the important thing is to spread out the rectangles perfectly, without overlapping them. Stuff the cannelloni: place some stuffing on the shortest part of the rectangle, then roll them up with wet hands [30].
Once the cannelloni [31] are rolled up, spread a little béchamel and a few spoonfuls of sauce [32] on the bottom of a baking pan, and place the cannelloni next to each other. Cover the top of the cannelloni with the remaining béchamel and sauce [33] 
and dust the surface with grated Parmesan cheese [34]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 15 minutes, then turn on the grill for another 3 minutes. Once baked [35], serve your cannelloni still hot [36]!
