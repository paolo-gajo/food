Succulent lasagna, irresistible baked potatoes and meatloaf are all typical Sunday dishes, but an impressive lunch table must have a steaming plate of tasty cannelloni. These succulent pasta rolls filled with a mix of meat and sausage, topped with béchamel sauce and tomato are a traditional dish from Emilia. This rich and delicious dish is perfect for a Sunday lunch, such as Easter, perhaps as a vegetarian version with eggplant or spinach! We've all tasted them at least once in our lives. The idea of cannelloni prepared by our grandmothers brings beautiful memories to mind, but by following our advice and a bit of patience, you can also make a dish worthy of grandmother's approval that will win over all your guests! Prepare them for your holiday dinner, too!
