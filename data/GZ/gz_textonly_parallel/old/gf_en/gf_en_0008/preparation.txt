To prepare the eggplant roulades, first wash and dry the eggplant, then remove the stalk and cut the eggplants lengthwise with a mandolin to obtain 12 slices around 2 mm thick (the thickness of a nickel)[1]. If you’d like, you can blot the eggplant slices with absorbent paper to remove any excess liquid [2], but this step is optional. Place the eggplant slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a convection oven preheated to 340°F (170°C) for 10 minutes [3].
In the meantime, heat the oil in a small saucepan and add the tomato passata [4]. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then season with salt [5] and pepper. Use the mandolin to cut the caciocavallo cheese into slices of the same thickness as the eggplant slices [6].
Now you can assemble the roulades: place a slightly cooled slice of eggplant on the cutting board, add a slice of cooked ham [7], and finish with a couple of slices of caciocavallo cheese [8], then roll up each slice of eggplant [9]. Continue until all the ingredients have been used up.
Place the rolls in a casserole dish with the part where the roll finishes facing downward [10]. Once they are lined up side by side in the casserole dish, pour over the tomato sauce prepared earlier [11]. Lastly, slice the remaining caciocavallo cheese [12]
and sprinkle over the roulades [13]. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 360°F (180°C) for 7 minutes, then turn the broiler to 460°F (240°C) and broil for another 3 minutes [14]. Your eggplant roulades are ready to be served [15], perhaps with a few leaves of fresh basil!
