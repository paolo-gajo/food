To prepare the stuffed eggplants, start by trimming the ends of the eggplants, then wash them, dry them, and cut them in half lengthwise. Cut them along the edge, extract the pulp from the eggplants using a scoop [1], and set it aside. Then salt (using coarse salt) the inner part of the eggplants [2], and place them with the hollow part down on a grill to drain the vegetable water for about 30 minutes [3]. After enough time has passed, rinse them before stuffing them.
In the meantime, prepare the tomato sauce: fry the chopped onion in half of the oil [4], add the tomato puree [5], let it cook for about 15 minutes, then salt and add the basil leaves, shredded by hand [6].
Heat a little oil and the clove of garlic in a pan [7]; once browned, remove the garlic, add the minced pork, and leave to fry [8]. When the meat begins to brown, deglaze with the white wine [9].
Now mince the well-drained eggplant pulp [10] and add it to the meat [11]. Let it cook until it wilts [12].
In the meantime, discard the crusts from the sliced bread and dice it [13]. Use a food processor to turn it into breadcrumbs [14]. Add this to the pan and let it cook for a couple more minutes [15].
Then add 3-4 tablespoons of tomato sauce and turn off the heat [16]. At this point, let the mixture cool a little bit [17], mix well, and use it to fill the eggplants [18], then season with salt and pepper.
Place the eggplants next to each other in an oiled baking pan [19], cover each one with a spoonful of tomato sauce, and sprinkle with grated Pecorino cheese [20]. Bake the stuffed eggplants for about 30 minutes at 180Â°C [21]. Serve your stuffed eggplants hot, but let them rest for a few minutes first.
