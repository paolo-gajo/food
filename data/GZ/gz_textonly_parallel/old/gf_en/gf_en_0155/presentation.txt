Stuffed eggplants are a typical dish of the Spanish peasant tradition that over time have spread widely in our peninsula, giving rise to an interesting range of variations. Each region has created its own version based on its own typical products, and many of them would like to boast that they were the first in the country to have invented the dish. Stuffed eggplants are a family "tradition", one of grandmother's classic recipes, especially in summer when this vegetable is abundant. It is no coincidence that stuffed eggplants are equally delicious both hot and cold! From North to South, they are stuffed with a variety of ingredients such as meat, pasta, vegetables, or rice and can therefore be served as appetizers, first courses, main courses, and side dishes, and sometimes even as desserts. The name of this dish changes according to local dialects as it moves from region to region and the type of stuffing and course changes. We decided to present one of the most classic recipes, namely eggplants which are emptied of their pulp and cooked together with meat to create a rich and tasty stuffing. Covered with plenty of tomatoes and sprinkled with aged Pecorino cheese, they are then baked in the oven to melt all the flavors together. Stuffed eggplants are also ideal for serving at room temperature on very hot days. Try them for yourself!
