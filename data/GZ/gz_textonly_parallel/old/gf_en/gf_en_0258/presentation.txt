Focaccia is an institution of Ligurian cuisine. Focaccia with cheese from Recco, or focaccia col formaggio, is another typical delicacy. The history of focaccia with cheese begins at the time of the Third Crusade when farmers from Recco, forced to take refuge in the hinterland because of Arab invasions from the sea, only had water, flour, oil and cheese at their disposal, so they invented this type of focaccia, which has remained in the local gastronomic heritage. At the end of the 19th century, when the first taverns began to appear, focaccia with cheese was included in the menu but was served only during the period of the remembrance of the dead. At the beginning of the 1950s, with the development of tourism, focaccia with cheese became one of the most popular dishes sought by tourists and for this reason, innkeepers and bakers began to serve it not only around the period of the remembrance of the dead, but throughout the year.
