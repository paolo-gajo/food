To prepare the braised meat with Barolo, start by making a seasoning bag. Put the cloves, peppercorns and cinnamon in a piece of sterile gauze [1]. Close and tie off with kitchen string [2]. Then also tie rosemary and bay leaves and movo on to the vegetables [3].
Clean the celery, carrot and onion, cut into 3/4- 1" (2-3) cm thick chunks, then clean the garlic clove [4]. Put the meat, vegetables, the bag and the seasonings into a large bowl [5]. Then cover everything with wine with the meat is completely covered [6].
Then cover with transparent wrap and let marinate in the fridge for at least 8-12 hours [7]. After the time has passed, drain everything without throwing away the base [8]. Take out the meat and place it on the cutting board, dry it with absorbent paper [9].
In a frying pan, melt the butter in the oil over medium heat [10]. As soon as the base is hot, add the meat and brown over a high heat [11]. Turn it on all sides so that a crust forms on the surface [12].
After a few minutes transfer the meat and its base into a large saucepan [13], heat for a moment over medium heat and add the drained vegetables [14] and let them season over a lower heat for about 15 minutes [15].
At this point you can add salt and cover up to half of the meat with the marinade [16]. Bring to a boil and then close with a lid, lower the flame a bit and let it simmer for 1 hour [17]. After the time has passed, turn over[18]
and, only if it is needed, add a little more marinade liquid [19]. Continue cooking for another hour [20]. Once the braised meat is cooked, take it out of the pot and put it aside on a plate covered with a lid. Remove the seasonings [21].
Before blending the vegetables and the base of the cooking liquid [22] with an immersion mixer, you can collect some liquid and keep it aside. This way you can add to it if needed to obtain the desired consistency [23]. In the meantime, slice the meat, to obtain 2-3 slices per person [24] and place on a serving plate; dab the slices with the sauce. Your braised beef with Barolo wine is ready, enjoy!
