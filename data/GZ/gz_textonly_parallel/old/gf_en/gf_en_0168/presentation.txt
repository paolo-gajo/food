When it comes to rich and succulent recipes, the Piedmont region rises above the field, unrolling some truly magnificent dishes. From the timeless vitello tonnato to the famous ravioli del plin. Then moving on through recipes such as salsa verde, the irresistible companion of boiled meats and sandwiches. Desserts? The best! The bonet or panna cotta, whose consistency never ceases to conquer the world's eager palates. And after this irresistible array of delicacies, which are part of the heritage of Italian cuisine, not even on purpose, we move on to the top of all the recipes: braised beef with Barolo wine. Very popular after the first course prepared using the eponymous red wine from Piedmont. A rich and succulent recipe to be made and given to guests during special occasions, and why not, even for the Christmas holidays. Since we don't like to waste food, we decided to fortify the cooking base by blending in the vegetables from the marinade, but if you prefer a brighter color and an even stronger flavor, just discard them and let the base reduce, thus obtaining a very colorful reduction. Now that you know everything there is to know about braised beef with Barolo, all you have to do is get to the stove to make this cult delicacy of our cuisine!
