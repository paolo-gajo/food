Inspired by the crispy golden breadcrumbs of breaded eggplant patties and the Mediterranean flavors and aromas of eggplant parmigiana, we thought we’d create a tasty blend of these two traditional recipes. This is how our breaded eggplant parmigiana patties are made. Two slices of eggplant surround the most appetizing of fillings made with tomato, mozzarella, and basil. This gooey concoction will set off a taste explosion at first bite. Everyone is bound to adore this simple delicacy and it’s the perfect finger food for informal dinners. But we recommend that you enjoy them hot, straight out of the pan to better appreciate all the fragrance of the double coating!
