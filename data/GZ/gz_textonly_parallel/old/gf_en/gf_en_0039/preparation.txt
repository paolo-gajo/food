To make the eggplant parmigiana patties, start by preparing the sauce: Fry the garlic clove in a little olive oil in a small saucepan [1], then pour in the tomato puree [2], cover [3], and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
While the sauce is cooking, cut the fior di latte cheese into shavings [4] and place in a strainer [5] to drain. Cut the eggplant into slices around? inch (2-3 mm) thick, making sure you get 16 slices of a similar diameter so you can match them into pairs [6].
By now the sauce will be ready; remove the garlic and add salt to taste [7]. Beat the eggs with a pinch of salt [8] in a low, wide bowl. Pour the breadcrumbs into another bowl. Now everything is ready to make the patties. Spread a level spoonful of sauce onto a slice of eggplant, making sure to leave a generous ½ inch (1 cm) before reaching the edge [9].
Add a few shavings of fior di latte mozzarella cheese, a basil leaf [10], and a teaspoon of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese [11]. Cover with a second slice of eggplant [12]
and press lightly with your fingers to make them stick together [13]. Dip the patty in the egg [14], then in the breadcrumbs [15]; 
then repeat, dipping first into the egg [16] and then into the breadcrumbs [17], taking care to seal the edges to stop the filling from leaking out during cooking. Heat the oil in a frying pan and start to fry when it reaches 340°F (170°C): Immerse the patties [18] and cook for 2 minutes on each side.
When they are golden brown, drain them [19], place onto paper towel [20], and add salt. Serve the breaded eggplant parmigiana patties immediately [21].
