If there’s one recipe that combines all the sweetness of creamy hazelnut spread with the freshness of a summer dessert, it has to be Nutella cheesecake: a super yummy dessert that doesn’t require any baking and is made without gelatin! The cream cheese is blended with Nutella to create a soft mousse that sits on a crunchy graham cracker crust. This cake is also ideal for the summer months because unlike the more classic New York cheesecake, for example, it doesn’t require the use of an oven, lending itself perfectly to being made on even the hottest days. A real temptation that’s impossible to resist, try this Nutella cheesecake and fall in love at first bite!
