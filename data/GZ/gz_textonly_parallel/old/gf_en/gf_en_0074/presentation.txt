On the neighborhood corner, the one that leads directly to the main square, Concetta, Rosalia and Santina sit comfortably discussing which is the authentic version of pasta with sardines, a typical dish in Sicilian cuisine. The first uses only bucatini, the second says the sardines to be used are the small ones which are more tender and tasty, while the third does not like saffron and prefers puree or tomato paste. Fortunately the three ladies agree on the three cornerstones: sardines, pasta, and the inevitable wild fennel to prepare a fabulous pasta with sardines. As you may have guessed, there are many versions, as our Sicilian friends could tell you... but we hope we have fully grasped the authentic and true soul of this dish, made with sweet and sour notes, warm earthy colors and intoxicating scents of the sea, as a good fish dish should be. Pasta with sardines combines all these suggestions for the palate and in the end will please everyone, including Concetta, Rosalia and Santina! And if you love sardines, try a version that combines sardines and broccoli!
