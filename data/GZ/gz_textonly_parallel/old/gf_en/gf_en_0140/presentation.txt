Live from Sunday lunch, an unbeatable classic on our tables: stuffed zucchini! Digitally-savvy grandmas can share their versions online, usually hidden in the family recipe books, and maybe reveal a few secrets or tricks to make it easier to prepare. As tradition dictates, no part of the zucchini goes to waste, and this recipe is proof of that: The flesh, once removed, is used to flavor the meat stuffing and the zucchini itself forms a little holder for the tasty filling. For the finishing touch, the top is used as a nice lid for the zucchini, giving it a shape that recalls an old-fashioned sugar bowl. Cute, but above all delicious, stuffed zucchini are a classic of Italian homemade cooking that we can’t resist! Here, we have Manuel’s recipe for you.
