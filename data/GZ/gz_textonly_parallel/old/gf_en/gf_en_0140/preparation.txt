To prepare the stuffed zucchini, wash the zucchini under running water [1], dry them with a clean cloth [2], and cut off the top to form the lid [3].
Score the inner perimeter with a small knife, then make an X in the flesh and remove one segment at a time [4]. Next, scoop out the inside using a melon baller or teaspoon [5], creating a shell around?” (1 cm) thick. This way, you’ll have both the lids and the shells ready to be stuffed. Season the insides of the zucchini with salt [6], 
then arrange them upside down on a tray lined with paper towel so they lose their liquid [7]. In the meantime, prepare the filling: Place the ground pork in a bowl and add the sausage with the skin already removed [8]. Then add the grated Parmigiano cheese [9],
the chopped zucchini flesh, the egg, lightly beaten [10], and the crumb of the bread, chopped up [11]. Now add the chopped parsley [12], season with salt and pepper,
and stir to combine until you get an even mixture [13]. Grease a deep baking pan with a good glug of oil [14]. Take the well-drained zucchini and fill each one to the brim with the meat filling [15].
Arrange the stuffed zucchini inside the pan with their lids [16] and bake in a conventional oven preheated to 320°F (160°C) for around 60 minutes (285°F (140°C) for around 50 minutes in a convection oven); you can remove the lids before the 60 minutes are up if they’ve softened and have taken on some color, while the stuffed zucchini filling will need to turn golden and crispy on top [17]. Once they’re ready, take your stuffed zucchini out of the oven and serve them hot or at room temperature, together with their lids [18]!
