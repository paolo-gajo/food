To prepare the lemon cake, first cut the softened butter into cubes, then transfer it to a stand mixer with a beater (if you don't have a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer); use the mixer and add half of the sugar a little at a time, until you get a smooth, frothy mixture [1]. Separate the egg whites from the yolks; while the mixer is running, add one yolk at a time to the butter and sugar mixture [2], waiting for it to be absorbed before adding the next. When the yolks are well blended, add the rind of the two grated lemons [3] and mix again with the beater.
In a bowl, sift together the flour, cornstarch, and yeast, then add them to the mixture one spoonful at a time while the mixer is running [4]. When the dry ingredients are well mixed, turn off the mixer and transfer the mixture into a bowl [5]. Clean the mixer well, and use it again to whip the egg whites (alternatively, you can also use a bowl and perfectly clean electric whisk): pour the egg whites [6] and start whisking,
then add the remaining sugar [7] and drizzle the lemon juice [8] and continue whipping until a dense, frothy consistency is obtained [9].
At this point you can add the whipped egg whites to the mixture previously set aside: start adding 2 ladlefuls [10] and stir vigorously to soften the mixture, then add the rest of the whipped egg whites and stir from bottom to top with a spatula to keep the air inside, and prevent it from coming apart [11]. When all the ingredients are well blended, pour the mixture into a cake tin with a diameter of 8-9 inches (22-24 cm), lined with baking paper [12],
level the surface [13] and bake in a static oven preheated to 355° F (180°) for one hour; if the cake darkens too much during baking, after about 40 minutes you can open the oven and cover with aluminum foil, then continue baking. When the cake is ready (always check with a toothpick), take it out of the oven and let it cool in the baking tin [14], then transfer it to a serving plate and let it cool completely, then sprinkle with powdered sugar. Your lemon cake is ready to be enjoyed [15]!
