"Don’t dare mess with snack time!": it's not a threat, but an invitation to take a break from work to sit down and enjoy a soft cloud of citrus-scented lemon cake! Lemon cake is a soft dessert that is simple both in its taste and preparation, making it ideal not only for snacks but also for breakfast for the young and old. Make sure to choose untreated and preferably organic lemons to enhance the taste and aroma of the main ingredient even more. There is no need to add anything else: let yourself be intoxicated by the scent of lemon cake, while your senses wake up at the first bite... after having tasted your slice, you'll be ready to dive back into the daily grind! If you're looking for a little "extra" while eating, don't be shy: fill it with creams or jams with citrus notes, such as lemon cream!
