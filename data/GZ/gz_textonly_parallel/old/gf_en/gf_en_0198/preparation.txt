To prepare the zuppa inglese (Italian trifle), start by making the pan di Spagna (sponge cake). Pour the eggs into a bowl at room temperature and beat them with a whisk while adding the sugar a little at a time [1]. Continue for about ten minutes or until the mixture becomes clear and frothy: you can also do the "writing" test by lifting a spoonful of the mixture and letting it drip as if you were tracing letters with it [2]. Next, place a strainer in the bowl and pour in the flour and potato starch [3].
Fold in the dry ingredients with gentle upward movements, making sure that no residue is left on the bottom of the bowl [4]. Pour the dough into a previously buttered and floured 7-inch (18 cm) round mold [5]. Level the surface with a rubber spatula and bake in a preheated oven, in static mode at 320°F (160°C) for about 40 minutes, placing the drip pan on the lower shelf (not in contact with the base); leave to cool and then remove from the pan [6].
Meanwhile, prepare the pastry cream. Pour the milk and cream into a saucepan [7], scrape the vanilla seeds, keeping them aside, from the pod and place the latter into the saucepan. Let it warm up to just under the boiling point [8]. In the meantime, pour the vanilla seeds on the yolks [9],
add the sugar, beat quickly and then sift the corn starch [11]. By now the milk and cream should be hot, so discard the pod [12]
and pour a couple of ladles into the egg mixture to dilute it [13]. Then pour into the pan [14] and stir with a whisk while cooking for a few minutes. As soon as the cream thickens, you can turn off the heat [15].
Divide the cream into two bowls [16] and pour the chocolate into one [17]. Take advantage of the fact that the cream is still very hot to help you dissolve it, then cover both creams with plastic wrap and let them cool down [18].
Take the cooled pan di Spagna (sponge cake), use 2 oz (70 g) of it, cut it into vertical slices 1/4-inch (1 cm) thick [19], and trim to fit into 4 glasses of 2/3 cup (150 ml) capacity [20]. Soak the sponge cake with alchermes, without exaggerating [21]
and proceed by pouring a little chocolate cream first [22] and then the vanilla cream [23]. Tap the glass to distribute the cream evenly and continue layering with soaked sponge cake [24],
and the two types of cream [25]. Level the surface with a spatula and repeat for the other glasses. Finally put them in the refrigerator to settle for at least a couple of hours [26]. Sprinkle unsweetened cocoa on your glasses of zuppa inglese before serving and enjoy your dessert [27]!
