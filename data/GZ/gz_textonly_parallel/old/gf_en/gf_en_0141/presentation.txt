Swordfish rolls are a traditional summer dish in Sicily, particularly of Catania. Swordfish rolls are prepared with thinly cut slices of swordfish and a filling with simple yet very tasty ingredients such as capers, olives, breadcrumbs, and tomatoes. Swordfish rolls pair well with many side dishes. An example? Peppers with capers or the famous scapece-style zucchini! These delicious morsels, also called "braciolettini" in some places, are such a popular dish that there are several variations of the recipe, some of which use pecorino cheese and pine nuts for the filling.
