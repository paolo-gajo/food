To prepare the swordfish rolls, start by preparing the filling: chop the olives and capers with a knife [1], cut the tomatoes in half, remove the seeds, then dice [3].
In a bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, capers, chopped olives, chopped garlic clove, and tomatoes [4], with half of a teaspoon of chili powder [5], fresh basil [6],
salt and season with a drizzle of oil [7]. Prepare the swordfish: cut the slices of fish in half [8], fill each slice [9] with approximately 1 1/2 tbsp of the filling.
Fold the edges along the long side [10] of the fillet first so that the filling does not come out, roll [11] and hold the swordfish rolls together with toothpicks [12].
Cut the tomato into slices [13] and set them aside, oil an oven dish, place the rolls inside [14] place a slice of tomato and a basil leaf on top [15], and finish preparing the other rolls in this manner;
Before baking, sprinkle the swordfish rolls with a handful of breadcrumbs [16], and season with a drizzle of olive oil. Place in a pre-heated oven at 350째 F (180째 C) for 10 minutes (or in a ventilated oven at 320째 F (160째 C) for approximately 8 minutes). When the rolls are golden on the surface, take them out of the oven and serve them hot.
