Eggs, sugar and fortified wine. Only three ingredients are required for one of the most delicious and mysterious creams in Italian gastronomic history. The origins of this egg cream are uncertain: it seems to have originated in the kitchens of Caterina de' Medici, while other sources date the first recipe of egg cream to the Gonzaga court. At home it is considered a robust snack in its most rudimentary version... sweet childhood memories! In bakeries it is transformed into a light, fortified, and frothy filling that embellishes many sweets. Master pastry chef Paolo Sacchetti has brought to Giallozafferano's kitchen the most intensely colored eggs, the most fragrant Tuscan Vin Santo wine and a sprinkling of sugar to give us all the secrets of a perfect egg cream. Prepare ladyfingers or any other cookie, because it will be ready in no time!
