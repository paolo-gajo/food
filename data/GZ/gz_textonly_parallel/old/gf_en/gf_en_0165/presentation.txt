Just say its name and there's a standing ovation at the table. It's the queen of single courses, the consolation for hurt feelings: eggplant Parmigiana. A recipe shared and disputed as to origins from north to south: Emilia Romagna, Campania (Parmigiana is mulignane) and Sicily (Parmiciana or Patrociane) with some variations in ingredients and ways to compose it, but all absolutely fabulous! Do you ever wonder why it's called that? The name "Parmigiana" comes from the Sicilian "Parmiciana", which in dialect means the stacked wood slats in blinds: think about how the slices of eggplant are arranged in the pan and you will see the similarities. Few ingredients, lots of flavor for a dish that is a symbol of Mediterranean cuisine: tomato, eggplant, basil and cheese... a mix that also goes perfectly with pasta as in the recipe for lumaconi alla parmigiana (snails parmigiana). But now make a succulent eggplant parmigiana with us!
