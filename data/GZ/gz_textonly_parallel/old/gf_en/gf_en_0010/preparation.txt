First peel the onion and chop roughly [1]. Drizzle some oil into a frying pan, add the onion, and brown for about 3 minutes. Then, pour in the rice [2] and stir to combine. Toast the rice for around 5 minutes over medium heat [3].
Next, add boiling broth [4] until the rice is covered. Then pour in the tomato puree [5] and stir well [6]. Continue to cook the rice by adding more hot broth as needed. 
Once cooked, with all the liquid absorbed, remove from heat. Add the grated Grana Padano cheese [7], a pinch of pepper [8], and season with salt if needed. If your broth was already salted, you shouldn’t need to add more. Next, transfer the cooked rice to a tray (or a pan lined with parchment paper) [9],
and distribute evenly using a wooden spoon [10]. Once the rice has cooled, transfer to the fridge to chill for 2 hours. Meanwhile, take the mozzarella and cut into large cubes measuring about ½ inch (1 cm) [11]. Once the rice has become nice and dense, take it out of the fridge. Now, you can make the supplì: First, moisten your hands so the rice won’t stick to them. Take a spoonful of the rice mixture and place in your hand. Press down lightly to make it longer [12],
then place some mozzarella cubes in the middle [13] and shape the rice with your hands to create a classic croquette shape, slightly elongated [14]. Repeat this process until you’re out of rice; with the quantities given here, you should get about 10 supplì [15].
Next, move on to the breading. Beat the eggs in a bowl, adding a pinch of salt [16]. Take one of the supplì, first dip it in the egg [17] and then dredge in the breadcrumbs [18],
so that it’s completely covered [19]. Now, repeat the breading process, dipping the supplì in the eggs again [20] and then dredging in the breadcrumbs [21].
Do the same with all of the other supplì, arranging them on a tray [22] as they’re ready. Heat plenty of corn oil until it reaches a temperature of 329°-338°F (165-170°C), then submerge two supplì at a time [23] so the oil stays hot. Wait a few minutes, and once they’re golden brown, drain them using a slotted spoon [24].
Transfer to a tray covered with paper for fried food [25], and repeat these steps until all the supplì are cooked [26]. Serve the mozzarella and tomato supplì hot and melty [27]!
