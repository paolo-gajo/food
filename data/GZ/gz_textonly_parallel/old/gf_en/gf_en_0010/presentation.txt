Supplì, little rice croquettes, are simply divine! Both the traditional ones that hail from Rome and the Lazio region, called “supplì al telefono” thanks to the mozzarella string that forms when you pull them apart, resembling a telephone cord, as well as these mozzarella and tomato supplì! This is an easier version that’s just as tasty. However, there are those who also love more modern and original variations, such as the supplì with prosciutto and scamorza cheese. Some of you might also have tried them flavored with cacio e pepe (Pecorino cheese and black pepper) or with the addition of vegetables. Any way you have them, these artfully fried little balls of rice are always delicious! For an extra stringy cheese effect, we recommend using mozzarella for pizza; otherwise, fiordilatte cheese will also work well. Leftover rice, from dishes such as arancini, is perfect for making these mozzarella and tomato supplì. Try them and share this little appetizer with us that has a taste of Rome in every bite!
