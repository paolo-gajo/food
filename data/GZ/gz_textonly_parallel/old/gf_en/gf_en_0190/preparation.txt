To prepare the cocoa sponge cake, first pour the egg whites into the bowl of a stand mixer [1] and start whisking at medium speed. Add sugar a little at a time, increasing the speed of the mixer [2]. The egg whites must be whipped until they are shiny [3].
While the mixer is running, sift the flour together with the starch [4] and cocoa powder [5]. Repeat the operation twice then set aside [6]. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan and let cool.
When the egg whites are whipped, pour the yolks into the mixer while in operation [7]. After having added the yolks, turn off the stand mixer: the mixture obtained should flow slightly from the whisk [8]. Pour part of the mixture into a bowl and add part of the powder [9].
Pour in the melted butter [10] and mix; then add this mixture to the rest of the whipped part, add the remaining powder and stir gently from the bottom to the top [11]. Now place the pastry rings with a diameter of 7 inches (18 cm) and a height of 1/3 inch (8 mm) on a drip pan lined with baking paper: you can bake 2 at a time and pour the dough inside [12].
Level the surface with the back of a spoon [13] and bake in a static oven preheated to 430° F (220° C) for 6-7 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it cool [14], then use a small knife to remove the sponge cake from the ring. Place the cocoa sponge cake on a rack to cool completely before using it for your creations [15]!
