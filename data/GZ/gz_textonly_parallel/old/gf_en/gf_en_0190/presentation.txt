Cocoa sponge cake is one of the variants of the traditional sponge cake, a basic preparation widely used in pastry shops. It is the ideal base for preparing delicious cakes to be filled with any type of cream, such as egg-free custard or classic custard cream. In addition to being used as a base for cakes, natural cocoa-flavored sponge cake is also perfect as a snack for children: just add a layer of jam to make it special! Also try filling it with fresh seasonal fruit to make it even better!
