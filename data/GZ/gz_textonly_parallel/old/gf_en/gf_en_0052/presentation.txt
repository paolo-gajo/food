A nice Caprese salad is just the kind of fresh, satisfying dish you need on a summer’s day, and today we’re sharing another side of mozzarella with you as we prepare an equally tasty summer appetizer in the form of the stuffed mozzarella roll. Did you know that microwaving the mozzarella in the water it comes in and adding more water allows you to bring the cheese back to a malleable consistency? This makes it easier to work with and roll out with a rolling pin before stuffing it with arugula, prosciutto, and vine tomatoes in a delicious recipe that will have you surprising your guests with an original and tasty appetizer. Try making your own mozzarella roll stuffed with whatever you fancy and let us know what wonderful creations you come up with!
