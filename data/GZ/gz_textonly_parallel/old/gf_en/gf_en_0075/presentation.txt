The one thing that most accurately characterizes people from Naples is their great sense of imagination and their ability to continually reinvent themselves, and this trait also manifests itself in the rich and varied cuisine of the Campania region, inspired by distant lands such as Poland, with the Neapolitan babà rum-soaked sponge cake, and France, with the traditional sartù di riso rice dish, as well as other territories much closer to home, such as Sicily. The Neapolitans were so impressed by the charm of authentic Sicilian cuisine that they tried to put their own twist on a dish as iconic as pasta alla Norma in the form of pasta alla siciliana. The ingredients used in this dish are clearly inspired by the traditional pasta alla Norma, with the exception of the salted ricotta cheese, replaced here by fresh mozzarella. The type of pasta used, so short and delicious, will make all the difference, and there are even some differences in the method compared to the original Norma, especially where the sauce is concerned, and... well, we don’t want to give too much away! Read on to find out how to prepare this delicious Sicilian-style mini penne pasta – the perfect dish for Sunday lunch or an informal dinner with friends.
