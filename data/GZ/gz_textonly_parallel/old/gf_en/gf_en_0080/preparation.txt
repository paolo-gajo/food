To make the pasta salad with ricotta and cherry tomatoes, first heat a pot filled with water that you’ll use to cook the pasta. Then turn to the sauce: Put the washed Pizzutello tomatoes, ricotta [1], basil, oil [2], and Parmigiano [3] in a food processor. 
Season with salt [4] and pepper and blitz until you get a cream [5]. Pour this cream into a large bowl that you’ll add the pasta [6] too.
Next, take the caciocavallo, remove the rind [7], and cut into small cubes [8]. Then take the Sardinian tomatoes, wash them, remove the stems, and dice [9].
At this point, cook the pasta [10] and drain once it’s al dente. Run under water to stop the cooking [11] and then pour into the bowl with the tomato and ricotta sauce [12].
Add the Sardinian tomatoes [13], caciocavallo [14], and Taggiasca olives [15].
Stir well to combine (16-17). The cold pasta with tomatoes and ricotta is ready [18]! You can serve it right away or put it in the fridge to eat it cold.
