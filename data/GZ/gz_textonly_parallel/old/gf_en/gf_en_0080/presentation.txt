Pasta salad with ricotta and tomatoes is a creamy, delectable first course that’s made for summer! To create the sauce, we were inspired by Sicilian-style pesto, and we kept the ingredients from this amazing region the same, which, all together, give the dish a nice splash of color. When we were experimenting, we realized that once cold, this pasta became even more flavorful, and to make sure it wasn’t missing anything, we added pieces of caciocavallo cheese, tomatoes, and Taggiasca olives. Besides being a really easy dish to make, it’s also super quick! Your cold pasta dish will win over all of your friends, whether on the beach or at home!
