To prepare fettuccine with octopus and porcini mushrooms, start by cleaning them: remove the soil from the base with a knife [1], then clean both the stem and cap with a dry cloth [2]. It is not advisable to wash the mushrooms, as they may absorb water. If very dirty with soil, you can quickly run them under a very light stream of water. Cut the porcini mushrooms into slices about 1/6 inch (4-5 mm) thick [3].
Pour a drizzle of oil [4] into a saucepan and saut√© a clove of garlic and chili pepper [5]. Add the sliced porcini mushrooms [6],
and add the peeled plum tomatoes [7]; tomato paste [8], laurel [9],
then add water [10] and, as soon as it comes to a boil, add the whole octopus (we used an octopus that was already eviscerated and cleaned) [11] and let it cook without a lid for at least one hour. Adjust the salt [12]
and flavor with thyme leaves [13]. After the cooking time has elapsed [14], boil some water in a large pot and add salt. Then drain the octopus from the sauce, transfer it to a cutting board [15],
and cut it into 1/2 inch (1-2 cm) pieces [16]. Transfer the sauce into the saucepan in which you will season your pasta, remove the garlic and add the pieces of octopus [17]. Continue to cook the sauce over low heat for about 10-15 minutes for it to reduce (it must be a fluid and not too watery). Cook the pasta for the time indicated on the package [18],
then drain it and put it in the pan with the sauce [19], stir well [20] and serve it steaming and garnished with more thyme [21].
