Creamy and delicate, crème caramel is a soft dessert loved all over the world for its simple goodness! It has ancient origins and is very reminiscent of Mexican flan, with which it shares both the aromas and the bain-marie technique. Similar in texture to an Italian panna cotta, crème caramel is actually made without the addition of gelatin or starches: the eggs will thicken the mixture themselves and, with gentle and careful cooking, will give you a perfect texture, smooth and compact, but at the same time enveloping and velvety. Accompany crème caramel with whipped cream or fresh fruit, or just enjoy the way it melts in your mouth!
