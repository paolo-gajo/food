To make crème caramel, first prepare the caramel: pour the sugar into a thick-bottomed saucepan [1] and let it melt over medium-low heat by swirling it around the saucepan and without stirring [2]. When the caramel has taken on an amber color, carefully pour it into six 3/4-cup (180 ml) molds placed inside a high-sided baking pan, swirling them to coat the base evenly [3]. Set the molds aside and continue with the recipe.
Pour the milk into a bowl and add both the seeds and the vanilla bean [4] [5], then bring it to a boil in a small pot [6]. Once the boiling point has been reached, remove it from the heat and let it steep for half an hour. 
Now remove the vanilla bean [7] and add the cream [8], stir and set aside for a moment. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar, but without whipping them to prevent air bubbles from forming [9].
Pour in the milk and cream mixture in a stream, filtering it through a strainer [10], then mix again with a whisk to obtain a homogeneous mixture [11]. Take the baking tray with the molds and distribute the milk and eggs mixture inside using a ladle [12].
Pour boiling water into the baking tray up to one third the height of the molds [13]. Now bake in a bain-marie in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for about 50 minutes. Once cooked, leave to cool [14] and transfer the molds to the fridge to cool for at least 4 hours.
