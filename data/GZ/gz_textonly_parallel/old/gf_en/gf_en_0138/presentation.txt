Many Italian dishes are actually regional delicacies as each region has its own distinctive culinary traits, from north to south. And it's not difficult to find the common denominators. Mediterranean cuisine, for example, is typified by certain aromas and colors, such as tomatoes, garlic, and oregano. One of the most versatile and widely used mollusks in Italian cuisine is the octopus. It’s a fixture on party tables in the form of salads or carpaccio, enveloped by layers of pasta in lasagna, and even rolled up in a tortilla wrap for casual dinners at home. Today, however, we’ve decided to prepare a tasty old-school octopus stew. Don’t get it confused with Luciana-style octopus, a Neapolitan recipe where the mollusk is usually cooked in its juices. This delicious recipe comes with an excellent sauce that is perfect for dipping bread to accompany the octopus portions rendered succulent by cooking in tomato sauce. The combination will be a real treat for your taste buds! So, are you ready to make stewed octopus? Here’s our recipe.
