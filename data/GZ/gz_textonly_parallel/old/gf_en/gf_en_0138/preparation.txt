To make stewed octopus, start by cleaning the octopus. After rinsing and drying the octopus, place it on a chopping board and cut across the head where the eyes are [1] to remove them. In the middle, underneath the octopus, you will find the beak, which you need to cut out using a small knife [2]. Lastly, clean out the head and rinse [3].
Next, peel the shallot. Slice [4] the shallot and place in a bowl, then peel the garlic clove and transfer everything to the stove. Heat a splash of oil in a large pan and add the garlic [5] and shallot [6].
Pour in the tomato passata and turn up the heat [7]. Season with salt and add the thyme leaves [8], sage [9], 
and water [10]. Heat well until the mixture comes to a boil, then dip the octopus tentacles in three times [11]. This will make them curl up nicely [12].
Make sure the tentacles have taken on their distinctive curled shape, then plunge the whole octopus into the sauce [13]. Cover with a lid and cook over medium heat for 50 minutes [14]. To be sure it’s cooked, remember to prick the octopus on the inside where the beak was located. If a fork penetrates the flesh easily, then it’s cooked [15].
Sprinkle everything with a grind of pepper [16] and transfer the octopus to a board, cutting it into pieces the size you prefer [17] and serving in its sauce. Your stewed octopus is ready. Enjoy [18]!
