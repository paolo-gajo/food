To make the baked trofie pasta, first prepare a béchamel sauce by following the method shown in the practical guide, using the quantities given in this recipe. Then skin the onion and chop it finely [1]. Heat a little oil in a pan, tip in the onion [2] and soften it over moderate heat. Remove the sausage casing [3], 
then coarsely chop the sausage [4]. Once the onion is soft, tip in the sausage [5], sauté for 4-5 minutes, then deglaze with the white wine [6] and allow it to evaporate.
Add the tomato puree [7], season with salt, and cook for 20 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile, place a pan of salted water on the stove and bring to a boil. When the sauce is ready [8], cook the trofie until they are al dente [9].
In the meantime, grate the provola using a coarse grater [10]. When the trofie pasta is ready, drain them into a bowl and add the sauce [11] and béchamel [12].
Mix everything together [13], then transfer the trofie into a baking pan. Cover the surface with the grated provola [14] and the grated Grana Padano DOP cheese [15].
The trofie is now ready for baking [16] in a preheated conventional oven at 430°F (220°C) for 20 minutes. Once ready, take the baked trofie pasta out of the oven [17] and serve them piping hot with the cheese still runny [18].
