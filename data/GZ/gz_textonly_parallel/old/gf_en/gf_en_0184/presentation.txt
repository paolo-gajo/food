Is there anything better than a classic tiramisu? No, but there are plenty of delicious variations that come close, including this wonderfully fresh strawberry tiramisu! Forget the energizing coffee syrup for a moment, and the generous dusting of unsweetened cocoa, and focus instead on the ladyfingers and the soft mascarpone cream perfectly complemented by a strawberry sauce and fresh strawberry pieces. A real treat in a glass, elegant and sophisticated, just like the wild berry version, and perfect served at the end of a mouth-watering meal – a guaranteed hit! We decided to make this dessert with pate à bombe, which allows you to pasteurize the yolks that will form the base of your mascarpone cream. The perfect end to a beautiful spring or summer lunch, or the first al fresco dinners of the year, no doubt leaving your guests very pleasantly surprised!
