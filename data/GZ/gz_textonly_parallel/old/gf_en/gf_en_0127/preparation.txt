To make spaghetti with tomato sauce, start by preparing the sauce. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with the peeled and halved garlic clove [1], so you can remove the core and make the scent more delicate. Cook for 2 minutes over high heat, add the peeled tomatoes [2] and salt [3].
Cover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour over very low heat: the sauce should simmer gently [4]. Mix it from time to time. After this time, remove the garlic [5] and pass the tomatoes through a sieve [6] to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree.
Pour the sauce [7] back into the pan, turn the heat to very low and add the basil leaves [8]. After a few minutes, turn off the sauce and keep it warm. All you have to do now is cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water [9].
Drain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce [10] and stir for a few moments over high heat to mix everything together [11]. Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do is serve it, garnished with fresh basil to taste [12]!
