To prepare potato gateau, start by boiling the potatoes. To do this, rinse the spuds and place them into a large saucepan, covering with plenty of cold water [1]. Place the pot over heat and, as soon as the water starts to boil, count about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes. Test them with a fork [2] to make sure that they are actually cooked: if the fork easily reaches the center of the largest potato, they are ready. Drain the potatoes and start peeling them while they are still hot, helping yourself with a small knife to avoid scalding your hands [3].
Finally, mash them immediately in a bowl: when they are hot, the potatoes are easier to mash and will virtually be lump-free [4]. In the meantime, dice the mozzarella cheese [5] and place it in a sieve to drain any excess liquid [6]. Alternatively, you can squeeze it with a clean cloth.
Dice the Neapolitan salami into about 1/3 inch (1 cm) pieces [7] and do the same with the slice of ham [8]. Now take the freshly mashed potatoes and add the eggs [9],
a sprinkling of pepper [10], salt, a drizzle of oil [11] and grated Parmesan cheese [12].
Mix the ingredients (13-14), and when the mixture is well amalgamated you can add the ham and the diced Neapolitan salami [15]. 
Pour the drained mozzarella cheese [16] into the bowl and mix all the ingredients [17]. Oil a 4x4-inch (20x20 cm) square baking dish [18]
and sprinkle with breadcrumbs [19]. Move the pan to ensure it is evenly coated with breadcrumbs [20]. Now pour the mixture in the pan using a spatula to level it [21].
Sprinkle the surface with breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese [22], season again with a drizzle of oil [23] and bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for about 30 minutes. Once ready, your potato gateau will be a steaming and inviting dish ready to be served [24]!
