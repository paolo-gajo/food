Potato gateau is a delicious dish made with potatoes and various cold cuts. A flan with an irresistible golden crust that will make a substantial dish. This famous, age-old dish is a cornerstone of Neapolitan cuisine, revisited in other regions of southern Italy. However, potato gratin did not appear on the luxurious tables of the aristocracy in the Kingdom of the two Sicilies until the end of 1700. In fact, the supreme palate of Queen Maria Carolina of Habsburg, wife of Ferdinand I of Bourbon, did not want to part with the delicacies created by her French chefs, called back to the court of the Kingdom of Naples. That was how the Neapolitan people learned how to make this dish their own. They replaced Gruyère with fior di latte cheese, and enriched the flan with ham and salami. And that's not all. The name was soon adopted and even the monsieurs did not escape the Neapolitan imagination, becoming "monzù"! Each family passes on their own version of this irresistible flan, and so we too have decided to share with you the recipe for potato gratin of Chef Roberto Di Pinto!
