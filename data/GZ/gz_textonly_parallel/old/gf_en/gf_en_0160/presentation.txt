Cotechino with lentils is a typical dish on the Christmas menu and especially on New Year's Eve: tradition has it that eating a portion of cotechino before midnight is a good omen for the New Year.Just to clarify, let's start by saying that cotechino is completely different from zampone (pig's trotter): in fact, although their content is the same, cotechino is stuffed in a natural pork casing, while the trotter, as the name says, is stuffed in the foot.Originally, cotechino was a simple dish that farmers used to eat with legume and vegetable soups. A typical product of Modena, a city in the Emilia-Romagna region, cotechino was once prepared exclusively by lardaroli and salsicciari, the formerly called beccai (butchers) who, starting from 1547, gathered in an independent guild. However, cotechino was first mentioned only two hundred years later, in 1745, in an almanac and the first recipe appeared the following year. The importance that cotechino has taken on today is due to the father of Italian cuisine, Pellegrino Artusi, who, in his extensive work, "Science in the kitchen and the art of eating well", speaks of the famous cotechino fasciato.
