To prepare soft focaccia, first pour crumbled yeast into the water [1] and stir until completely dissolved [2]. Pour flour into the bowl of the stand mixer with a hook attachment [3].
Add the water and yeast mixture [4] and start kneading at low speed. Add the salt [5] and finally drizzle with oil [6].
When the dough is smooth and homogeneous, stop the mixer. It will take about 10 minutes [7]. Grease the worktop [8] with a drizzle of oil, then place the dough onto it [9].
Work it with your hands [10] just long enough to form a ball [11]. Then transfer it to a bowl and cover plastic wrap [12].
Leave to rise for 2 hours at room temperature. Once risen, remove the leavened dough [13] and carefully grease a 2-inch deep, 10-inch diameter baking pan with oil [14]. Place the dough in the center and spread it evenly over the width of the pan
Cover with plastic wrap [16] and leave to rise for 1 hour in the oven with the light on at a temperature between 77°-82° F. Meanwhile, prepare a mixture of water and oil [17] [18].
After the leavening time has elapsed, take the dough and press the surface with your fingertips to create the typical holes of the focaccia [19], then spread the water and oil mixture [20] and salt flakes [21] on top.
Add rosemary leaves [22] and bake in a preheated, ventilated oven at 390° F for 40 minutes. Once cooked, remove your soft focaccia from the oven [23], let it cool down and remove it from the pan, then serve it warm [24]!
