To prepare penne all'arrabbiata pasta, drain the peeled tomatoes. Then transfer them into a bowl [1] and crush them with a fork [2] to break them up [3].
Now chop the dried chili peppers with a knife, or crumble them with your hands [4]. Put a pot full of water over heat, salt to taste, and cook the pasta. Then pour abundant oil into a pan [5], add the peeled garlic clove [6]
and chili peppers [7]. Leave to slowly brown [8], then add the tomatoes [9],
stir everything and adjust the salt [11]. Then cover with a lid [12] and let cook for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When the sauce is almost cooked, also cook the pasta al dente, following the cooking times indicated on the package [13]. After 12 minutes, remove the lid [14] and remove the garlic [15].
Drain the pasta and transfer it directly into the sauce [16]; toss for a moment [17] and add cooking water if necessary [18].
Add the chopped parsley [19], stir one last time [20] and serve your penne all'arrabbiata still hot [21].
