Penne all'arrabbiata is a traditional Roman dish, known throughout Lazio. This region gives us a dish that has now become part of the culinary culture of the entire country, as has happened for spaghetti cacio e pepe and pasta alla carbonara. Penne all'arrabbiata is a specialty prepared with a few simple ingredients, but a strong flavor, made with a sauce of tomatoes saut√©ed in garlic and chili peppers. Featured in many unforgettable films such as Ferreri's Grande Abbuffata or 7 kili in 7 giorni, penne all'arrabbiata is a very popular recipe, and often used as a late night snack during gatherings among friends because it is easy and quick to make. The name "arrabbiata" means "angry". It seems to derive from the fact that those who eat the penne all'arrabbiata risk turning red in the face because of the chili pepper, which is the color of the face of angry people, hence the name of this dish. You can decide whether to enrich this pasta with Pecorino Romano DOP cheese or enjoy it as is!
