To prepare the trofie pasta with creamy zucchini and pancetta, first boil a pot of water to cook the pasta. In the meantime, wash the zucchini, trim them, cut them in half lengthwise [1], then in half again, and finally slice them [2]. Take the pancetta and cut it first into slices and then into strips [3].
Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the whole peeled garlic clove [4] and fry briefly, then add the pancetta and zucchini [5]. Season with salt [6] and pepper and cook over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so they don’t brown too much.
Once the required cooking time has passed [7], remove a ladleful of squash and pancetta from the pan and set aside for decoration. Remove the garlic. By this point, the water for the pasta will have come to a boil. Add some salt and cook the trofie for the time stated on the package [8]. In the meantime, transfer the zucchini and pancetta mixture remaining in the pan to a tall, narrow container [9], add a couple of ladles of the pasta cooking water,
and blend with an immersion blender [10] until smooth and consistent [11]. Pour the resulting cream back into the pan, with the heat off [12].
Once the trofie pasta is cooked al dente, drain and pour straight into the pan [13], and stir the sauce thoroughly. Finally, add the squash and pancetta that you’d set aside for decoration [14] and plate up: Your trofie pasta with creamy zucchini and pancetta is ready to be served [15]!
