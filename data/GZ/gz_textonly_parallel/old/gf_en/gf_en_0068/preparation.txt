To prepare red miniature pizzas, first place the flour in a bowl together with the crumbled fresh brewer's yeast [1]. Add water at room temperature [2] and stir with a wooden spoon [3].
Add sugar [4], salt [5] and pour in oil [6].
Mix the ingredients thoroughly [7], then transfer to a work surface [8] and knead vigorously [9] until smooth.
Form a ball with the kneaded dough [10], oil a large bowl and place the dough in it, cover with plastic wrap [11] and let it rise for about 3 hours at room temperature, away from drafts or in an oven with the light on. Once the dough has risen, it will have tripled in volume [12].
In the meantime, prepare the pizza topping: in a bowl pour the tomato, season with salt [13], pepper, oregano and oil [14]. Mix everything with a spoon [15] and set aside until you need to use it.
Transfer the leavened dough onto a pastry board and sprinkle with very little flour [16]; roll out with a rolling pin until you obtain a rectangle about 1/4-inch (4 mm) thick (17-18).
Oil thoroughly the drip pan where you will cook miniature pizzas. Cut the dough with a 3-inch (7.5 cm) diameter round pastry cutter [19]. Take the excess dough [20], give it a round shape [21]
and let it rest covered for about 10 minutes [22]. You can knead any excess dough and make more pizzas: you will get a total of 24 miniature pizzas! Take them one by one with a spatula [23] and start placing them on the baking tray [24].
Once the miniature pizzas are on the tray, apply some pressure in the center, leaving a 1/4-inch (0.5 cm) edge. Cut mozzarella cheese into cubes [27]
and season the center with tomato [28] and mozzarella cubes [29], drizzle with oil and a pinch of oregano to taste. Bake the miniature pizzas in a static oven preheated to 400°F (200°C): the first 10 minutes with the tray on the lower shelf; the remaining 5 minutes on the top shelf. Once cooked [30], take out the red miniature pizzas and serve them hot!
