To prepare the graffe donuts, wash the potatoes, then boil them [1]; it will take about 30 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes. Prepare the yeast in the meantime: in a bowl add the dehydrated brewer's yeast [2] to the sifted flour and mix it with the lukewarm milk [3] until a homogeneous mixture is obtained.
Cover the yeast with transparent wrap [4] and let it rise in the oven with the light on for 1 hour (otherwise cover it with a wool cloth and let it rise in a place away from drafts). When the potatoes are cooked, peel them, mash them with a potato masher [5] and let it all cool down. Place the two sifted flours and the honey in a stand mixer with flat beaters [6].
Add the sugar [7], the mashed potatoes, whichby now have cooled down [8] and the grated rind of a whole lemon, well washed and dried [9].
Beat the eggs slightly and add them [10], then turn on the mixer with the flat beater: when the dough is firm and collected on the beater, replace it with the dough hook and add the yeast [11]. Continue working the mixture until the yeast is well incorporated, then add the salt and the softened butter one piece at a time, waiting for it to be absorbed before proceeding with the next [12].
Then put the dough on the work surface lightly greased with a little melted butter and work it with your hands to make it smooth [13]. Make it into a ball [14] and place it in a bowl covered with transparent wrap [15], and let rise for 2 hours in the oven with the light on (or covered with a lid and left in a place away from drafts). The ideal temperature to make it rise is 79-82째 F (26-30째 C).
After this time, put the dough on the work surface, greased with the remaining melted butter, and make it cylindrical in shape [16], then divide it into portions of about 2 oz (60 g): shape each part into a ball [17], flatten it slightly and pierce it in the center [18],
then gently widen the hole: with our amounts you'll have 20 graffe. Place the donuts made this way on a drip pan lined with baking paper [19], cover with transparent wrap or a cloth and let rise in the oven off with the light on for 1 hour: they should double in volume. When leavening is complete, start heating the seed oil in a large saucepan, it should reach 325째 F (160째 C). Cut the baking paper under each graffe so as to make a support and not have to move them by hand and risk ruining their shape [20]. When the oil has reached the indicated temperature, gently immerse them with the baking paperand then remove the paper [21]. Fry them one at a time, a couple of minutes on each side to brown evenly.
When they are well browned on both sides, drain the graffe from the oil with a skimmer and let them dry on a tray lined with paper towels [22]. Place the granulated sugar in a container that you must roll the doughnuts in still hot [23] to cover them completely with sugar: your graffe are ready [24], serve them hot!
