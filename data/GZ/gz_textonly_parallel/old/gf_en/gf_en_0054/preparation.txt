To make fried mussels, you first need to clean them. Once you have scrubbed the shells clean with a scouring pad and removed the beard inside[1], open them while they are still raw. To do this, simply hold the mussel with your left hand, slide the blade of a small knife between both halves of the shell and push outward [2]. Then separate the two halves of the shell, leaving them still attached [3].
Put the opened mussels in a colander that you have placed over a bowl and carry on opening the other mussels [4]. Now make the stuffing: set the colander containing the mussels to one side, then the the water released by the mussels [5] and add the coarsely crumbled bread [6].
Knead everything together with your hands [7], then add the Parmigiano Reggiano DOP cheese [8] and the finely chopped parsley [9].
Add another cup (40 g) or so of breadcrumbs [10] and the eggs [11]. Blend everything until the mixture is uniform [12].
Season with salt and pepper [13] to taste. Now you need to fine-tune the consistency of the mixture by adding more breadcrumbs to compensate for the water released by the mussels until the consistency is dry and firm. Arrange the mussels on a tray and fill with approximately 1 teaspoon of the freshly prepared mixture [14], then pack the mixture down and re-close the shells slightly [15].
When you have filled all the mussels [16], heat the oil to 340°F (170°C). When it is hot, submerge a few mussels at a time using a slotted spoon [17]. Take great care because the oil may splash out at this stage. After about 3-4 minutes when the mussels are golden brown, remove them with the slotted spoon and drain them [18].
Transfer the mussels to a sheet of paper towel [19] and continue frying all the others [20]. Serve your fried mussels while they are still hot [21]!
