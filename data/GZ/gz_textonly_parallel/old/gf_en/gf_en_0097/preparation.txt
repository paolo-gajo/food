To make pasta alla cenere, start with the olives. Place them in an immersion blender cup [1] and pulse to chop roughly (2-3). You could also chop them roughly using a knife.
Next, bring a pot of salted water to a boil to cook the pasta and, while you’re waiting for it to boil, prepare the Gorgonzola. Remove the crust [4] and cut the cheese into small cubes [5], then transfer to a pan together with the light cream [6].
Turn the heat to low and let the cheese melt, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon [7]. Now cook the pasta; you’ll need to drain it 2-3 minutes before the time stated on the package [8]. As soon as the pasta is drained and ready, pour it directly into the cheese sauce[9].
Add a ladleful of pasta cooking water and finish off the cooking in the pan, stirring frequently [10]. Once the pasta is fully cooked, add the olive pâté [11] and stir well to blend. Dish up your pasta alla cenere and serve with a good grind of black pepper. Buon appetito [12]!
