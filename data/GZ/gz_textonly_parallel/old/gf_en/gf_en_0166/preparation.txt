To prepare Chicken Cacciatore (Chicken stew with peppers), start by cutting the vegetables. After peeling the onion, peel the carrot and trim it, finally remove the top from the celery and chop it all until it is diced about 1/10" (2-3 mm) [1]. Then start cleaning the chicken. Cut it into pieces separating the thighs, chest and wings [2]. At this point you have everything you need so go to the stove. Heat a drop of oil in a saucepan, do not overdo it because the skin of the chicken will release a lot of fat. Light the flame and let it warm up for a few moments, then put in the chicken pieces, starting with the skin side down [3].
Let it brown for about ten minutes, turning it after a bit [4]. When the chicken is well colored add the chopped celery, carrot and onion and then the peeled clove of garlic [5]. Then add salt, pepper and rosemary, stir and let it flavor together for another 5 minutes [6].
Blend with red wine and let the alcoholic part evaporate completely [7]. Now remove the rosemary and garlic clove [8] and add the chopped peeled tomato pieces [9].
Mix everything together [10] and cover with a lid, let cook over moderate heat for 30-35 minutes [11]. Remember that if the chicken is bigger then you will need to increase the cooking a little bit more, and vice versa if it is smaller. In any case, the chicken is considered ready as soon as the meat detaches from the bones [12].
When finished cooking, make sure it is salted right and then sprinkle with parsley [13]. One last stir [14] and your chicken cacciatora is ready. Enjoy your meal [15]!
