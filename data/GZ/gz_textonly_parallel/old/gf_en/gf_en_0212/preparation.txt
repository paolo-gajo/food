To prepare the banana bread, start by peeling the bananas [1] and cutting them into slices [2]. Pour them into a bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent them from blackening [3].
Crush them with a fork [4] to reduce them into a puree, then set aside. In another bowl, pour the chopped butter, soft but still pliable, and the sugar [5]. Whisk with a hand mixer [6]
and when you have obtained a homogeneous mixture add the eggs, possibly one at a time to combine them better [7]. Add a pinch of salt [8], then pour in the banana puree [9].
Mix with a flexible spatula [10] and add the sifted flour with baking soda and baking powder [11]. Flavor with cinnamon [12] and stir again.
Pour the dough into the 9x3.5" (22.5x8.5 cm) plumcake pan and level it off [13]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 60 minutes. Try the toothpick test at the end of cooking, then remove your banana bread from the oven [14] and let it cool before removing it from the pan. Enjoy the banana bread alone [15] or with butter, peanut butter or jams.
