To prepare the white wine and parsley scaloppini, prepare the vegetable broth and keep it warm. Clean the parsley, remove the leaves [1], then finely chop it and set it aside [2]. Cut 8 slices from the piece of meat [3],
moisten them with very little water [4] and start beating them with a meat tenderizer. Proceed by squeezing and stretching: the meat will thin without tearing [5]. At this point, melt the butter over medium-high heat in a sufficiently large pan [6],
when the bottom is hot and the butter is melted, quickly flour the slices of meat [7] and place them in the pan. Let them brown for a few moments on one side and then on the other, turn with tongs [8]. Then blend with the white wine and let the alcohol evaporate [9].
When the broth has evaporated, add a pinch of salt and pepper and let the seasoning sink in for a couple of minutes over medium heat [10]. Gently jiggle and shake the pan and then turn the slices. Turn off the heat, flavor with the previously chopped parsley [11] and your white wine and parsley scaloppini are ready. Enjoy your meal [12]!
