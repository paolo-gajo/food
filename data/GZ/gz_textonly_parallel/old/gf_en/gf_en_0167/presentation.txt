"This is a dish that you have to give to the Milanese, being a specialty of Lombard cuisine. So I intend to describe it without any pretense, for fear of being mocked". This is how Pellegrino Artusi introduces the recipe of the Milanese-style ossobuco in the first recipe book in the history of Italian cuisine: a representative dish that seems to date back as far as the Middle Ages, characterized by a particular cut of meat made extremely tender by the long cooking time and the presence of the marrow, which dissolves and makes the preparation even more succulent. Another distinctive feature of ossobuco a la Milanese is the added gremolata, chopped parsley and garlic scented with lemon peel that completes and enhances the flavor of the veal. Usually proposed as a single dish together with the inevitable risotto with saffron, ossobuco alla Milanese can also be served as a tasty second course, perhaps in the version with peas or accompanied by a nice portion of polenta. We too, like Artusi, choose to present our version of the Milanese-style ossobuco in a simple and unpretentious way... we let the taste speak for itself and take you on a journey through the traditional flavors of this territory.
