To prepare the saltimbocca alla romana, start by slicing the veal nut [1], then place each slice on a cutting board, remove any nerves and fat and then beat it with a meat tenderizer [2] to make it thin. Place a thin slice of prosciutto in the middle [3];
and a sage leaf [4]. Use a toothpick to keep the ingredients together [5]. Pour 1/4 cup (40 g) of butter and 1 1/2 tbsp (20 g) into a pan and melt over medium-high heat.
Flour the slices of meat on one side only [6] and gradually place them in the pan with the sauce [8], increase the temperature so that the saltimbocca are golden brown. Pepper to taste, but do not salt because the prosciutto will make the dish tasty.
When the meat is golden underneath, blend with the white wine [10] and let it evaporate. As soon as the alcohol has evaporated completely, cover with the lid and cook for another minute. Transfer the saltimbocca to a plate and keep them warm.
Now take care of the accompanying sauce: add 1 1/2 tablespoon (20g) of butter [13] and water [14] in the same pan with the cooking liquid of the meat. Reduce [15] until you have created a slightly dense cream.
Now spread the cream on the bottom of a serving plate [16] and place the slices of meat on top [17]. The saltimbocca alla romana are ready to serve [18].
