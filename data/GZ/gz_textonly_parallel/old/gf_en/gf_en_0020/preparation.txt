To make the mini pasqualina tart parcels, first clean the chard by removing the toughest part of the stem [1], then chop the leaves roughly and wash under running water [2]. You should end up with around 1? lbs (600 g) of clean chard. Cook the chard in salted boiling water for around 3-4 minutes [3].
Meanwhile, boil the eggs as well: Place in a saucepan with plenty of cold water, turn on the heat [4], and cook for 8-9 minutes from when the water comes to a boil. Once the chard is cooked, drain and cool under running water [5], then transfer to a tall, narrow container and blitz with an immersion blender [6].
Empty the blended chard into a bowl and add the ricotta [7], grated Pecorino [8], grated nutmeg [9], salt, and pepper.
Stir well to combine and set aside [10]. Once the eggs are cooked, cool under running water [11], then shell carefully and set aside in another bowl [12].
Now you’re ready to assemble your mini pasqualina tart parcels: Unroll the first sheet of puff pastry and divide into 6 equal rectangles measuring around 4x5 inches (11x12 cm) [13]. Place a spoonful of the chard mix in the middle of one of the rectangles [14], arrange a hard-boiled egg on top [15], and try to compact the filling a little by pressing down gently with your hand.
Add another spoonful of the chard mix on top of the hard-boiled egg [16], then cover with another puff pastry rectangle and press down carefully around the edges to seal [17] the tart. Fold the edges up toward the center to make sure that the filling won’t come out during cooking [18], and then repeat these steps with the second sheet of puff pastry. You’ll get 6 parcels in total.
Once they’re ready, transfer the parcels to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Whisk the egg yolk and cream [19] to create a wash you’ll use to brush the parcels. Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for about 25 minutes, on the middle rack, until the surface has turned golden brown. Take your mini pasqualina tart parcels out of the oven [20] and let them cool before serving and enjoying [21]!
