To prepare the meatloaf in the oven, first remove the crust of the fresh bread with a knife [1], cut it into cubes and transfer it to a bowl: in all, you will need about 1 1/3 cups (150 g) of crumb. Pour the milk [2] into the bowl so that the bread absorbs and softens. In the meantime, break the sausage into small pieces after removing the casing [3].
Pour the ground beef into another bowl [4], then add the sausage [5], the grated Pecorino cheese [6],
the bread soaked in milk and squeezed slightly [7], whole eggs [8], nutmeg [9], a few fresh thyme leaves, salt and pepper.
Knead the mixture with your hands to mix all the ingredients uniformly [10], then make it the shape of a cylinder making sure to push it together well [11]. Place the meatloaf on a sheet of baking paper, brush it with olive oil [12] and set it aside for a moment.
Now preheat the oven to 350째 F (180째 C) in static mode and prepare the side dish: rinse the potatoes under running water [13] and divide them in half [14], then clean the shallots and cut them into 8 parts [15].
Transfer the potatoes into a bowl and add the thyme leaves [16], coarsely chopped sage leaves [17], salt and pepper [18].
Add the shallots [19], season with olive oil [20] and mix well [21].
At this point take a large baking tray, grease the bottom with olive oil and pour the mixture of potatoes and shallots inside [22]. Place the meatloaf in the center of the pan [23] and bake in a preheated static oven at 350째 F (180째 C) for 80-90 minutes. After the cooking time has elapsed, take the meatloaf out of the oven and serve it hot together with the potato side dish [24]!
