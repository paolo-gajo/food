Simply delicious! This is how we would define our apple and mascarpone cake, a dessert for everyone to prepare at home, a butterless variant of the more traditional apple pie in which the addition of creamy mascarpone cheese ensures its softness and delicate taste. Enjoy it with a dusting of powdered sugar for breakfast or a snack, and you will make the whole family happy. If accompanied with a scoop of cream ice cream or vanilla sauce, it will become a perfect dessert to end a dinner on a sweet note!
