To make the apple and mascarpone cake, first peel the apples, remove the core [1] and cut them into irregular cubes [2]. Pour the whole eggs and sugar [3] into a bowl.
Add a pinch of salt [4] and whip with hand mixer until frothy [5]. Add the mascarpone cheese [6] and whip.
Next add the sifted flour a little at a time [7], then the yeast [8]. While whipping, flavor with the seeds of the vanilla bean seeds [9].
To finish, add the apple cubes [10] and mix them in the dough [11]. Butter and flour an 8-inch (20 cm) cake pan [12].
Pour the dough inside and level it with a spatula or the back of a slightly dampened spoon [13]. Cook in a static oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for 50 minutes. When it is cooked, bake the apple and mascarpone cake [14], let it cool down and then remove from the pan and garnish with powdered sugar to taste [15].
