To make almond crunch, pour the peeled almonds onto a baking tray [1] and toast them in a static oven preheated to 375° F (190° C). It will l only take a few minutes, so make sure they don't burn. In the meantime, make the caramel: take an unglazed steel pan and pour in the honey [2], sugar and a few drops of lemon juice [3].
Mix to even out the ingredients [4] and melt over medium heat, using a kitchen thermometer to monitor the temperature of the caramel [5]. Once the temperature reaches 285° F (140° C), pour the toasted almonds into the pan with honey while still hot [6].
Mix [7] and wait until the temperature reaches 340° F (170° C). Remove from heat and pour the mixture onto a baking tray lined with baking paper, and spread it with a wooden spoon [8]. Let cool at room temperature [9].
When the almond crunch has cooled down, place it on a chopping board [10] [11] and cut into bars [12] before serving.
