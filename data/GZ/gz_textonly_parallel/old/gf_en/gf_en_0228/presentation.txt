Almond crunch is a traditional Christmas dessert made with almonds and sugar. Almonds are featured in various preparations in this periodÂ and almond crunch is among the sweets that best enhance their unique taste and crunchiness. Its origins are debated: it is made in many regions of Italy, especially in central-southern Italy, and all of them have their own tradition. There are written testimonies of almond crunch in a Spanish text from 1475, which suggests Spanish origins, but others suggest that it was created in southern Italy around 1200, as a derivation of a typical Arabic cake made with almonds, honey, sugar, and spices. In various Italian provinces there are events in honor of this delicacy: artisans compete to create beautiful sculptures, such as in Sestola (MO), or in San Marco dei Cavoti (BN). Here we offer you the recipe for the traditional version.
