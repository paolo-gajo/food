To prepare the choux dough, first pour the water, milk, salt and sugar [2] into a saucepan. Add the diced butter [3]
and bring it all to a boil. Now add the flour all at once [4] and stir with a spatula or wooden ladle. Don not worry about lumps and stir quickly, then cook the roux until a white patina forms on the bottom of the pan [5], it will take at least 2-3 minutes. Transfer the resulting dough into a bowl [6],
and add one egg at a time [7] stirring constantly with a spatula. Do not worry if the dough looks separate at first, just keep stirring. Only when it is completely absorbed do you add the next one [8]. Continue stirring to obtain a smooth and consistent dough [9]. Then transfer it inside a pastry bag, with a smooth 1/2" (12-13 mm) nozzle.
At this point, take a baking pan and line it with baking paper; to make the paper stick, squeeze a bit of the dough into the corners and center. Gently squeeze walnut-size dollops of dough, spacing them apart (10-11). Using a slightly wet spoon, lightly press the surface of the balls to flatten the top of each one [12].
Then beat the yolk in a bowl with a little water [13] and use it to brush the surface of the choux pastry [14]; this will give it a uniform color. Cook in a static oven at 440° F (220° C) for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Avoid opening the oven at this stage; after this time, finish cooking at 350° F (180° C) for another 15-20 minutes, venting the stove a bit by inserting a small ball of aluminum foil between the oven door and frame. If you prefer to bake the choux pastry using a ventilated oven, you will need to heat the oven to 440° F (220° C), put the pastry in, reduce the temperature to 350° F (180° C), and wait about 20-25 minutes. Take out the choux [15] and let them cool before filling them.
In the meantime, make the chocolate sauce for the coating. First chop the chocolate [1], then pour the water [2] and sugar [3] into a saucepan. 
Bring to a boil [4] and as soon as it starts to boil add the cream [5]. Let come to a boil again [6]
and add half of the dark chocolate [7], then stir constantly with a whisk [8] while adding the remaining chocolate [9]. 
Continue stirring and as soon as it starts boiling [10], transfer to a bowl and add a pinch of salt [11]. Stir [12] and let cool at room temperature to about 85-90° F (30-32°) until it is thick enough to coat the choux. This will take about 15- 20 minutes.
While the sauce cools, prepare the Chantilly cream for the filling. Pour the cream into a very cold bowl. Start beating the cream with an electric beater [1], or with the electric whisk if you prefer; as soon as it starts to thicken, add half of the powdered sugar [2] and the vanilla bean seeds [3].
Continue beating with a whisk [4] and before it has reached a very firm consistency, add the remaining powdered sugar [5]. Continue beating until the cream is completely whipped [6]. 
At this point everything is ready to assemble the chocolate profiteroles. Take the choux and pierce the base using a smooth nozzle [1]. Transfer the Chantilly cream into a pastry bag [2] fitted with a smooth nozzle. Stuff the choux [3] 
and place them on a tray [4]. Cover them with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for a few minutes. Now all you have to do is to put the finishing touch on the dessert. Place a rack on a sheet of baking paper, then dip the profiteroles one at a time into the chocolate sauce [5]. With the help of two forks, move the profiterole so that it is completely covered [6]; 
then pull it out and place it on the rack [7]; this way the excess coating will drip off. Once you have coated all the profiteroles [8], start placing them on a plate [9]
in the form of a pyramid [10]. Decorate with a few dollops of Chantilly cream, left over from the filling [11] and put in the refrigerator until serving [12].
