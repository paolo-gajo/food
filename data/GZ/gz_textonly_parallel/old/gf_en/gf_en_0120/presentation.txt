There are dishes whose flavor derives not only from the simple and smart mix of ingredients, but also by the legends that accompany them. Fettuccine Alfredo, spaghetti alla Nerano or arrabbiata pasta, for example. Surely spaghetti puttanesca (tomato, anchovy, olive and garlic spaghetti) is also a favorite with its savory condiments: peeled tomatoes, Gaeta olives, capers, and anchovy fillets give these spaghetti a unique taste. But it is also the unusual name of the recipe that makes it even more appetizing and arouses curiosity about its origins, which are disputed to be between Lazio and Campania. The spiciest and most imaginative stories are born behind the closed doors of houses, as a very quick dish to prepare with a few simple ingredients. Others trace it back to the culinary fantasies of Antonio De Curtis, aka Tot√≤. Still others lead back to the first spaghetti alla puttanesca in Ischia, in the famous night club Rangio Fellone of the 50s. It was here that this quick and somewhat arranged preparation with what was left in the pantry was created with olives, capers, anchovies and some tomatoes. The term "alla puttanesca" would indicate precisely that this is an improvised, easy and very quick preparation. Since then it seems that the dish has become a staple of restaurant menus, and has spread beyond the island as a traditional Italian dish.
