To make puttanesca pasta, first rinse the capers under running water to remove excess salt [1], then dry them and chop them coarsely [2]. Take the pitted gaeta olives and crush them with the blad of a knife [3].
Wash and dry the parsley, then chop it [4]. Place a pot full of water over heat and bring to the boil (salt when it boils); it will be used to cook the pasta. In the meantime, pour the oil, the peeled whole garlic cloves and chopped dried chilli pepper [5] into a large pan. Add the anchovy filets [6]
and desalinated capers [7]. Brown over medium heat for 5 minutes stirring frequently, so the anchovies melt and release their aroma. After this time, pour in the lightly crushed peeled tomatoes [8], stir with a spoon, and cook for another 10 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile, boil the spaghetti al dente [9].
When the sauce is ready, remove the garlic cloves [10] and add the crushed olives [11]. Flavour the sauce with fresh chopped parsley [12].
In the meantime the pasta will also finish cooking. Drain it directly into the pan [13] and saut√© for half a minute, just enough time to mix all the flavors together [14]. Serve the spaghetti alla puttanesca very hot [15].
