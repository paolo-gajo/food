To prepare the calamarata, start with garlic, skin it and crush it with the palm of your hand [1]. Then clean the chili pepper, remove the seeds [2] and finely chop it [3].
Then wash the tomatoes, dry them, and divide them into 4 parts [4]. Start cleaning the calamari. First rinse under running water [5], then remove the inner part by pulling the head. From the latter eliminate the white part with the cartilage; from the head, remove the eyes and squeeze the beak in the center [6].
Peel off the skin using a paring knife [7] and rinse again before cutting it into rings about 3/4 inch (2 cm) [8] wide. Move to the stove; put plenty of salted water to boil in a pan and then cook the pasta. Place a pan on the stove. Heat the oil together with the whole peeled garlic clove and chopped chili pepper [9].
As soon as the bottom is hot, raise the temperature and sear the calamari rings [10]. After a few seconds, simmer with white wine until the alcohol has completely evaporated [11]. Then remove the garlic, add the cherry tomatoes and tomato paste [12].
Stir, add salt [13], then lower the heat, and let it cook for about ten minutes; when done cooking, sprinkle with chopped parsley [14]. In the meantime, cook the pasta until it is halfway cooked [15].
As soon as the pasta is cooked, take a ladle of cooking water and pour it into the pan [16] then drain the calamarata pasta and toss it into the pan [17]. Mix a few moments and add water as needed so that the mixture is liquid, but does not come apart [18].
Place a sheet of parchment paper [19] on top of a sheet of aluminum foil, put a couple of ladles of pasta in the middle [20] and close the parchment paper first [21]
and then the aluminum foil as if they were candy [22]. Arrange them on a drip pan [22] and bake in a static oven, preheated to 390° F (200° C), for about 10 minutes. Your calamarata pasta is ready… you just have to serve it [23]!
