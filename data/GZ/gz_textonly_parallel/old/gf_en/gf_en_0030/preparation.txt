To prepare gnocco fritto (fried dough) first mix the water with the milk [1]. Pour the flour, baking powder for salted preparations [2], sugar and salt [3] into a bowl.
Mix the dry ingredients, then incorporate the lard [4]. Knead with your hands and pour the milk and water mixture in a stream [5]. Once the dry ingredients have absorbed the liquids, transfer the dough to a floured pastry board [6].
Form a compact and dry small loaf of dough, place it inside a bowl, cover with plastic wrap [7], let the dough rest in a cool place for at least one hour and up to 12 hours. After this time, take the dough again [8], sprinkle the pastry board lightly and divide it into small loaves with a knife [9].
Take a small loaf (cover the rest with the bowl) and flatten it with a rolling pin until you get a very thin sheet, 1/16-inch thick [10]. Cut the edges of the pastry sheet with a wavy pastry cutter [11]. Then cut 4x3-inch (8x7 cm) rectangles [12]. You should get about 50 pieces. Don't throw the cuttings away, just knead them back together.
Once cut out, cook the rectangles of dough in hot oil at 340°F (170°C) for about 1 minute, not more than 3-4 pieces at a time [13]. Once golden on one side, turn it over and cook the other side [4]. Drain on absorbent paper [15] and continue with the remaining pieces of dough. Your gnocco fritto (fried dough) is ready, enjoy it hot!
