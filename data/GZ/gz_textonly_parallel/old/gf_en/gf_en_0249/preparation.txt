To prepare pizza margherita, first of all start making the basic dough. Pour water at room temperature into a cup, add the yeast [1] and stir with a teaspoon so that it melts completely [2]. We have chosen to knead by hand, but if you prefer you can also prepare the basic dough in stand mixer, using the hook and operating it at medium-low speed. Then in a bowl, combine the two flours [3],
then add about half of the water in a thin stream and [4] knead with your hands [5]. Then add the salt [6] and the remaining water.
Continue working the mixture with your hands until you the result is uniform [7]. At this point add the oil, still a bit at a time [8], continuing to knead to help its absorption. Then transfer the dough onto a flat surface and knead it vigorously for a few minutes [9]
until it is smooth and elastic [10]. Once you get a nice smooth dough, let it rest on the work surface for about ten minutes covering it with a bowl. After it has rested give it a small fold: imagine that the ball is divided into 4 parts, take the end of each one, pull it gently and fold it towards the center, finally make it the shape of a ball [11]. Transfer the dough thus formed into a bowl, cover with transparent wrap [12] and let it rise. For convenience you can put the bowl in the oven off but with the light on, so the inside will reach a temperature of 79°-82° F (26°-28° C), ideal for rising; alternatively you can also keep the bowl in a warm place. The times are approximate as for each preparation, the temperature and weather conditions affect the dough rising: on average the dough should take 2 hours to double in volume.
When the dough is well risen [13], transfer it to a flat surface by gently turning the bowl upside down [14] and divide it in half using a dough scraper [15]; if necessary you can sprinkle the surface with a little flour.
Go back to folding the dough, as you did before the rising, then turn it upside down and proceed with the stretching: stretching the dough means turning it with your hands on the worktop, dragging it towards you and then moving it away repeatedly until you get a smooth and regular ball [16]. Transfer the two halves onto a tray [17] and let them rest for another half an hour, still covered with wrap or a cloth [18].
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475° F (250°) in static mode and prepare the ingredients for the filling. First place a strainer on a bowl and with your hands shred the mozzarella [19] and place it in the strainer [20]. That way you'll lose all the excess whey. Pour the tomato pulp into another bowl and season with salt [21],
a swirl of oil [22] and oregano [23]. Mix everything [24] and as soon as 30 minutes have elapsed, start the mixing again.
Dust the worktop and place one of the two halves on it. Squeeze it lightly with your hands [25], then stretch it out by applying light pressure and making a rotating movement [26]. Avoid crushing the bubbles too much and if the dough is too elastic wait a few minutes before working it again. Then lift the disk of dough, put your hands on it closing your fist and rotating it; this way it will stretch further [27].
Lightly grease a baking pan with a diameter of 11" (28 cm) [28] and put the dough on it, using your hands to make it regular in shape [29]. Sprinkle with half of the tomato [30] and bake in a static oven preheated to 475° F (250° C) for 6-7 minutes, on the middle rack.
After this time, add the fior di latte cheese bake the pizza [31], add the fiordilatte cheese [32] and bake again for 6-7 minutes at the same temperature. Then take out your pizza margherita and garnish it with fresh basil leaves [33].
