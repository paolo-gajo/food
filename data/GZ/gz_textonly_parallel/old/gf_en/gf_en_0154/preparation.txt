To prepare the baked salmon steaks, first remove the fish bones with kitchen tweezers [1] and check that there are no bones left by sliding a fingertip on the pulp. Remove the backbone with a knife [2], then roll one end on itself and wrap the other end around the slice to obtain a medallion [3].
Tie the medallion with a kitchen string to ensure it maintains the shape even during cooking [4] and transfer the medallions on a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Take a fairly regular shaped potato, wash it and cut it into thin slices with a mandoline, without peeling it: the slices must be maximum 0.04 inch (1 mm) thick otherwise they will not cook properly [5]. Now take care of the dressing: grate the zest of a lemon in a bowl [6],
add 2 tbsp (25 g) of lemon juice [7], oil [8], white wine [9],
the chopped parsley [10], salt and pepper [11] and mix well with a fork [12].
Season the salmon medallions with part of the dressing [13], then cover them with the potato discs slightly overlapping on one another [14], and sprinkle the potatoes with the remaining dressing [15].
When the medallions are ready [16], cook in a static oven preheated at 356째F (180째C) for about 20 minutes, then turn on the grill at 464째F (240째C) and continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes, until the potatoes are golden brown. When the salmon medallions are ready [17], remove the kitchen string and immediately serve your delicious baked salmon stakes [18]!
