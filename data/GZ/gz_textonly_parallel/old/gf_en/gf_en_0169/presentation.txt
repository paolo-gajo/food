The frittata is a classic dish, perhaps one of the first with which we experiment in the kitchen. You can indulge yourself with versions rich in fresh ingredients that are perfect for the spring season such as spring, radish, or asparagus frittata. In winter, you can try your hand at the red beet frittata. Before creating elaborate versions, we suggest that you start with the recipe for a classic frittata simply prepared with beaten eggs and Parmesan and Pecorino cheese, to be baked in the oven. There are those who cook it over a high flame and those who, like us, prefer slower cooking with the lid on. Grandmothers suggest thyme leaves to enhance the taste, and there are those who would never serve it without at least a dash of pepper. How do you make it? But above all, how do you prefer to eat it? On its own, in a sandwich, served as a delicious appetizer, cut into small pieces, or in rolls? While you think about it, come with us to the stove to prepare a soft and tasty frittata!
