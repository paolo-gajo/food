Have you ever thought about how many things you could make with a quick pizza mix? Today we want to surprise you with a one-serving wonder: pizza muffins! Inspired by the Internet craze for cruffins (a cross between croissants and muffins) and other original, super-tasty fusions, we came up with this cute little morsel that is bound to brighten up your buffet. Pizza muffins are a happy union between pizza ingredients and the tried and tested American muffin shape: soft bites that melt irresistibly in your mouth. They make perfect finger food at an informal dinner with friends or to be enjoyed as a tasty snack in front of the TV, perhaps with our equally soft and tasty pizza donuts. Watch them fly off the plate! Try our delicious pizza muffins. Weâ€™re sure that this marriage made in heaven will be love at first bite!
