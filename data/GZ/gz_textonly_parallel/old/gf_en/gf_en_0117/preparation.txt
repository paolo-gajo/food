To make the fresh dough, pour a little less than 3 cups (400 g) of flour into a bowl (it is best to keep a bit aside to add if necessary) [1] or directly onto a wooden pastry board for its porosity. Make a crater in the middle and add the whole eggs stirring [2], with the fork and at the same time start to mix in the flour [3].
Once the liquid part has been absorbed, start kneading by hand [4]: transfer to the pastry board or a wooden surface and knead there for about 10 minutes, with the palm and vigorously, pulling it in all directions [5] but taking care not to tear it. Once the dough is smooth [6],
wrap it in the plastic wrap [7] and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Then you can resume working the dough. Cut a piece with the pastry cutter [8], taking care to keep the rest in the wrap so that it doesn't dry out. Flour the piece of pasta [9]
and pull it with the sheet maker [10] at maximum thickness and pass the dough between the rollers to obtain a thick first sheet [11], fold the two edges of the sheet towards the center [12].
to give it a more regular shape [13], then dust again with a little flour and pass it again between the rollers [14]; once you have obtained a rectangular sheet, lay it on the slightly floured pastry board and trim the ends with a pastry cutter or a knife [15],
then divide it into two parts [16] so that it can be handled more easily, going gradually to the thinnest thickness until it reaches the penultimate thickness [17]. At this point your fresh egg pasta is ready and you can make the pasta shape you prefer [18]: you can find all the instructions at the bottom of the recipe.
