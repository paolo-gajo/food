To make the fried chicken with quick mayonnaise, start by cutting the chicken breasts into strips [1], you should get some rather long sticks, then transfer them to a baking pan and season with salt, pepper, rosemary sprigs, lemon zest [2] and juice [3],
season with olive oil [4] and spice with strong paprika [5], stir to flavor the chicken well, then cover with plastic wrap [6] and set aside to marinate.
Meanwhile, make the mayonnaise: pour the soy milk into the bowl of the mixer, add salt, rice vinegar [7] and vegetable oil [8], then mix everything with a hand blender [9]
until a homogeneous sauce is obtained [10]. Divide the mayonnaise into three separate bowls [11] and flavor each bowl in a different way: flavor the first one with wasabi [12],
the second with mustard and honey [13] and the last with tabasco and chives [14]. Mix the three mayonnaises well and set aside [15].
Now make the breadcrumbs: pour the cornflakes into the mixer, add a sprig of rosemary [16]. Now you can bread the chicken fingers: prepare three bowls containing the flour, beaten egg and crushed cornflakes [18].
Take a chicken fingers, pass it first in the flour [19], then in the egg, and finally in the cornflake mixture [20]. Bread all the chicken fingers and place them on a tray as you go [21].
Fry the chicken in abundant seed oil, brought to a temperature of 340° F (170° C) (to better monitor the temperature, we suggest the use of a food thermometer). Cook the sticks for a couple of minutes [22], then drain them on a tray lined with paper towles [23] and serve the fried chicken hot with the three types of mayonnaises [24].
