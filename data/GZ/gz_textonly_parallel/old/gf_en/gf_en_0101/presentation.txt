Baked pasta is the Sunday dinner dish par excellence. Tasty and rich, this recipe will really please everyone! The version that we propose is very substantial and includes using tomato sauce (although there are versions which are plain, with vegetables or vegetarian), delicious meatballs, besciamella, provola cheese, parmesan cheese and boiled eggs, which, combined with the pasta, will create an unforgettable dish! When preparing pasta in the oven, it is very important to pay attention to cooking the pasta, which must be drained halfway cooked, to avoid overcooking it due to the long time it will spend in the oven which will give it a really inviting top crust!
