To prepare a warm octopus and potato salad, start with the potatoes: place a large saucepan filled with cold water on the heat and submerge the potatoes in their skins, after washing them thoroughly [1]: leave them to cook for about 30-40 minutes from the moment they come to a boil (a fork test will tell you if they are cooked: if you can insert the fork without resistance, they are ready). You can halve the cooking time by boiling the potatoes in a pressure cooker. Meanwhile, clean the octopus: Turn the head inside out and scoop out the contents, remove the beak in the middle of the tentacles using a small knife [2] and then discard the eyes [3];
then rinse thoroughly under running water [4]. (If you are using a fresh octopus, we recommend beating it with a mallet to tenderize the flesh. As an alternative or next step after beating, you may decide to freeze it for a couple of days). Pour plenty of water into another pan, add the bay leaves [5] and bring to a boil. Once the water reaches boiling point, submerge only the octopus tentacles in the boiling water for a few moments and then lift the octopus out of the pan [6].
Repeat this process 2-3 times, or until the tentacles are very curly [7]. After that, submerge the whole octopus in the water, cover with the lid and cook for 50 minutes over moderate heat [8]. For optimum cooking, allow about 20-25 minutes per 1.1 lb (500 g) of octopus. Meanwhile, when the potatoes are cooked, drain, and peel them, taking care not to burn your fingers [9]
and cut them into 1-inch (2-3 cm) chunks [10]. Set aside and keep warm. Prepare the citronette dressing: pour the squeezed lemon juice [11] into a dressing shaker and add the olive oil [12],
season with salt and pepper [13], close the spout [14], then shake the bottle to mix [15]. 
Wash and finely chop the parsley [16]. As soon as the octopus is ready, drain it [17] and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Place on a cutting board, separate into two halves, cut off the head [18]
and detach the tentacles from the central body, then cut everything into chunks measuring approximately 1 inch (2-3 cm) [19]. Tip the octopus into a large bowl, add the warm potato cubes [20], and dress the salad with citronette flavored [21]
with the chopped parsley [22]. Mix everything gently to coat with the aromatic dressing [23]. Your warm octopus salad is ready to serve [24]!
