To make honey balls, melt the butter and let it cool. In the meantime, put the flour, sugar [1], eggs, a pinch of salt, grated orange peel [2], and melted butter [3] in a bowl
with the anise liqueur [4]. Start kneading by hand in the bowl, then transfer the dough to a pastry board [5] and knead until a compact and homogeneous dough ball is created [6].
Cover with a clean cloth [7], then let rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. After the rest time has elapsed, take the brick [8], divide it into 6-7 equal parts with a knife [9].
With each piece, create sticks approximately 1/3 inch (1 cm) [10] thick. Cut the sticks into small 1/3 inch (1 cm) pieces [11] and place them on a sheet, ensuring that they do not overlap [12].
To cook the balls: heat the peanut oil in a pot, and when it is hot, dip theballs with a skimmer [13]. For optimal frying, make sure that the oil reaches a temperature of approximately 355° F (180° C) with a food thermometer. To keep the temperature stable, only cook a few fritters at a time. Mix with a skimmer to obtain a uniform cooking; 2-3 minutes will be enough to obtain a golden color at the right point; drain them [14] and transfer to a tray covered with absorbent paper to dry the excess oil [15].
Let the balls cool and melt the honey in a pot over low heat [16], when the honey has melted pour over the Struffoli and stir to amalgamate [17]. Turn off the heat and let cool, then add the colored sugar [18].
Cut the candied oranges and citron into small cubes (19-20), pour them into the pot with the balls, [21] and stir gently with a spoon.
Take a serving dish, place a glass jar in the center of the dish that will be used to create the crown shape, and distribute the balls [22] around the jar. When the honey has solidified, gently remove the jar from the center of the dish [23]. Decorate with candied cherries and silver-colored candied almonds, then serve your Struffoli [24].
