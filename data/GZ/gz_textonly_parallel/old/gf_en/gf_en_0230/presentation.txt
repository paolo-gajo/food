Neapolitan tradition is full of recipes, including sweet ones such as "mostaccioli", black cherry cookies, curly puff pastry, shortbread and the inevitable "struffoli", sweet fritters that are the most characteristic desserts of the Christmas holidays. For those who have never heard of struffoli before, they are small balls of sweet dough that are fried, dipped in honey, and decorated with colored candies and candied fruit. As for the origins of sweet fritters, we must go back to the age of the ancient Greeks who apparently exported them to the Gulf of Naples in the era of Parthenope. According to many, the name "struffoli" is also derived from the Greek word "strongoulos", or "rounded shape". Other theories argue that the Italian word "struffolo" derives from the word "rubbing", the gesture made by those who work the dough, to roll it into cylinders before cutting it into chunks. Still others think that the sweet honey balls earned their name because they "rub" the palate, or tickle it with their sweet taste. Despite being a very well known and appreciated delicacy, the honey balls are mostly popular in southern Italy, where there are several versions all similar to the original recipe but with different names: in Calabria they are called "cicirata" or "turdiddi", in Umbria and Abruzzo "cicerchiata" and in Palermo "strufoli".
