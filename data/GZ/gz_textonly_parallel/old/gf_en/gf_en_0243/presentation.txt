Thanks to Gabriele Bonci today we will discover all the secrets of liquid sourdough. Also called levain (li.co.li, yeast in liquid culture) it is a natural yeast that long leavening bakery products can be made with. Mixing flour and water triggers a vital process, which starts, strengthens, regenerates and passes on ... but first of all, we must understand what the differences are with solid sourdough starter because this is the only way you can choose which is best suited to your needs. Liquid yeast, like the solid one, allows obtaining a better product organoleptically compared to bread, pizzas, focaccia and sweet leavened products made with brewers yeast; in fact the result will be more fragrant, digestible and will last longer. Compared to solid sourdough, liquid sourdough is easier to maintain and use. In addition, having a higher percentage of water, liquid yeast will be less acidic and will allow obtaining less dense alveolation and a lighter bread. As the days of fermentation pass and the refreshments are done, you will notice a very strong lactic (yogurt) smell, a bouquet almost of honey and flowers with a slightly acidulous note: these are the characteristics of a healthy sourdough starter! In conclusion, levain is suitable to prepare pizza or bread, for very hydrated doughs and for doughs that "must be made cold", i.e., mature in the refrigerator for more than 24 hours.
