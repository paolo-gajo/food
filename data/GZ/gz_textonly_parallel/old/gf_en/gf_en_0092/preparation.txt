To make pasta alla vesuviana (spicy pasta), clean the red onion and slice it thinly [1]. Also cut the fresh chilli pepper [2] and olives [3] into thin slices.
Carefully drain the mozzarella and cut it into small pieces [4]. Place a pot full of salted water to boil, which will be used to cook the pasta. Pour the olive oil into a pan [5], add the onion [6]
and chili pepper [7]. Let the onion stew over medium heat adding a couple of ladles of water from the pasta until the onion is soft and golden. Now pour the peeled tomatoes [8] and crush them slightly with a wooden spoon [9]. 
Then season with olives, capers [10] and salt. Cook the sauce for about 12 minutes over low heat. In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in boiling water for the time indicated on the package [11]. When the sauce is cooked, add the mozzarella cheese [12]
and add the fresh oregano [13]. Drain the pasta, transfer it directly into the pan with the sauce and stir with a ladle of cooking water [14]. Mix and serve your pasta alla vesuviana (spicy pasta) hot [15].
