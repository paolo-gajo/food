When having a quick dinner with friends, what better way to whet your guests’ appetites than to offer them these deliciously gooey mozzarella sticks? If you love fried mozzarella or mozzarella in carrozza (fried mozzarella) you won’t be able to resist these tasty, flavorsome mozzarella sticks, encased in a breadcrumb and cornflake batter to make them even crunchier. And that’s not all… we suggest serving them with a spicy, piquant, slightly tart sauce that goes perfectly with the mozzarella sticks, bite after bite.
