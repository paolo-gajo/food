To make the Danubio dolce, start by melting the butter (in a microwave or bain-marie). Then begin to prepare the dough: pour the sifted flour [1] into a planetary mixer equipped with a flat beater: grate the rind of an untreated lemon [2], then add the sugar [3], 
the seeds of a vanilla bean [4], and the dried brewer’s yeast (you can also use fresh brewer's yeast: in this case use 1¼ tbsp (12 g)). Turn on the planetary mixer to blend the ingredients, then pour in the milk [5] and medium egg [6] at room temperature.
Then add the melted butter [7] and when the ingredients are starting to clump around the beater, stop the planetary mixer and replace the flat beater with a dough hook attachment. Then add the salt [8] and water and continue to knead until the dough has become soft and uniform [9].
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, knead it for a while and make a ball [10]. Place it in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap [11]; let it rise for 2 hours in an unheated oven with the light left on. While the dough is rising, you can get on with making the pastry cream; pour the milk and cream into a saucepan and place over low heat [12] 
together with the grated rind of an untreated lemon [13] and the seeds of a vanilla bean (you can steep the cut vanilla bean [14] and remove it later if you want a more intense vanilla flavor). Pour the egg yolks and sugar [15] into another pan (you can use the leftover egg whites to make meringues or cat’s tongues).
Beat the egg yolks and sugar, then sift in the cornstarch [16]. Mix again and then drizzle in the previously heated and flavored milk (be sure to remove the vanilla bean, if you used one, before pouring in the milk) [17]. Stir until the pastry cream has thickened to the ideal consistency [18].
Now turn off the heat and transfer the pastry cream to a shallow, wide ovenproof dish: cover with plastic wrap [19] to prevent an unsightly skin from forming on the surface. Then allow it to cool to room temperature before placing it in a refrigerator. When the dough has leavened to twice its size [20], roll it out into a ball on a lightly floured (or oiled) work surface [21].
Use a pastry dough cutter (or sharp knife) to cut 30 pieces weighing 1 oz (30 g) each [22]. Squash each piece flat with your hands or roll out with a rolling pin [23], then fill with a spoonful of the pastry cream, which will now be cold and set [24].
Fold each flat disc in half, pinching and sealing the edges thoroughly so that the filling doesn’t come out (25-26). Do the same for all the balls. Assemble the Danubio by placing the balls on an 11-inch (28 cm) diameter cake pan lined with baking parchment. Arrange them in a radial pattern starting from the outer perimeter [27] and working towards the center.
Cover your Danubio dolce with plastic wrap [28] and let it rise for another hour in an unheated oven with the light on. Brush the surface with egg beaten with a tablespoon of milk [29], then bake in a conventional oven preheated to 360°F (180°C) for 30 minutes (320°F (160°) for approximately 20 minutes for fan ovens). When the Danubio dolce is ready, take it out of the oven and let it cool [30]. Dust the Danubio with powdered sugar then serve it directly from the pan and tell your guests to tear off the balls with their hands!
