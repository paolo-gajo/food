Banana cake is a soft and tasty sweet treat that’s great for breakfast, at tea time, or even with a coffee. Made with banana pulp and chopped walnuts, this is the perfect fruit cake for kids, too, and is ideal as a snack. The banana is a fruit that is great for eating on its own, but even better for making desserts. Just take our banana upside-down cake, or our banana and peanut ring cake, for example. It’s best to use ripe bananas for this cake, as they will have more flavor and be more fragrant. In fact, this banana cake is also a great way to use up overripe bananas that are really past their best. Basically, it’s just the perfect recipe, wouldn’t you agree?
