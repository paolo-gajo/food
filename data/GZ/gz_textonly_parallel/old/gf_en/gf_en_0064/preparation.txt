To make caponata (eggplant salad), first clean the onion and slice it thin [1]. Trim the celery and cut it into thin slices [2]. Cut the green olives in half and remove the pits [3].
Wash and dry the eggplants, trim and cut them into approx. 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick pieces [4]. Do the same with the tomatoes [5]. Heat a frying pan and toast the pine nuts for a few minutes [6]
until they are golden in color [7]. Now take your eggplants: put the olive oil in a high-sided pan and heat it, pour a few eggplant pieces in at a time and fry them for a few minutes [8]. Once they are golden, drain them with the skimmer and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper to remove excess oil [9], then set aside.
In a large pan pour a generous round of olive oil, heat it and then pour in the onion [10]. Fry well until the onion has a light golden color, then add the celery [11]; let it brown well, then add the capers [12],
olives [13], roasted pine nuts [14] and tomatoes [15].
Brown for a few moments, then cover with the lid [16] and cook over low heat for 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the sweet-and-sour sauce: pour the vinegar, tomato paste [17] and sugar [18] into a small pot.
Mix well with a teaspoon [19] and, after 15-20 minutes of cooking, add salt and pour the sauce into the pan [20]. Turn up the heat and stir until the smell of vinegar has evaporated. Turn off the flame, add the fried eggplant [21]
and sprinkle with plenty of basil [22]. Mix everything well [23], transfer the caponata (eggplant salad) in an ovenproof dish and put it in the fridge. This dish should be served cold or at room temperature and will taste even better the next day.
