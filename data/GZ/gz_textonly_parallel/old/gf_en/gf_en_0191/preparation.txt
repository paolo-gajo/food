To prepare the shortcrust pastry dough using the sanding method, start by pouring the flour into a mixer [1] (if you want, you can use a stand mixer) together with the cold butter cut into pieces [2]. Run the blades several times until a sandy mixture is obtained [3]. Use the mixer intermittently to ensure that the mixture does not overheat.
Turn off the mixer and add the powdered sugar [4] together with the lightly beaten eggs [5] and then grate the rind of an untreated lemon, ensuring to not grate the white part, without the white bitter pith [6].
Beat with the mixer again for a few moments, this time lowering the speed so that the blades mix the dough without blending [7]. As soon as the mixture has come together [7], transfer it to a pastry board [8].
Quickly compact the dough with your hands to prevent gluten formation [10]; do so just long enough to get a smooth and homogeneous loaf. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least a half an hour (although the longer the dough is left in the refrigerator, the more the gluten will relax and the butter will have time to cool, 10-12 hours would be even better) [11]. Remove the shortcrust pastry dough which can now be used in various recipes for tarts and cookies. To roll the dough out well, simply place it on a lightly floured work surface (alternatively between two sheets of baking paper) and beat it first for a few moments with the rolling pin before rolling, so as to restore its plasticity and a little heat [12].
