To prepare lasagne alla Bolognese, start with the meat sauce. Prepare the vegetable broth and ensure to keep it warm. Then take the pancetta bacon, cut it into strips first [1] and then chop it well [2]. Separately, finely chop the carrots, onions, celery and set aside [3].
In a saucepan, pour a drizzle of oil and the pancetta bacon. Use a ladle to spread it well [4] and let it brown for a few minutes. Then add the chopped vegetables [5] and cook for 5-6 minutes [5]. Then add the minced meat [6]. Stir and raise the heat. Let the meat brown slowly, it must be well browned to seal the juices and be soft.
Deglaze with red wine [7] and let it evaporate completely before adding the tomato puree [8]. The Bolognese sauce must cook for two hours. When it starts boiling again, you can add some hot broth, one or two ladles [9], and let the sauce cook for another couple of hours at least.
Let it cook with the lid on, without covering the pan completely [10]. Check and stir from time to time, add more broth when needed and let it cook. Now move on to the pasta. First, pour the spinach into a pan [11], add a little water, cover with a lid [12]
and cook until they are wilted, it will take 5-6 minutes in total [13]. At this point, drain them, let them cool and squeeze them well [14]. Transfer the spinach to a mixer [15]
and blend them until you get a puree [16]. You will need to get approx 3.5 cups (100 g) of it. Now on a pastry board pour the semolina and 00 flour [17], add the spinach and create a fountain shape. Add the lightly beaten eggs [18]
and egg yolks [19]. Begin to knead everything starting from the center [20], this way the eggs will not slip out of the fountain. Knead well until you get a homogeneous dough [21].
Wrap it in plastic wrap [22] and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. In the meantime, prepare the béchamel sauce. Heat the milk in a saucepan [23], without boiling it. In another pan, place the butter [24] and let it melt.
Add the flour in one go [25] and cook for a few minutes until you get a golden roux [26]. Then, pour the hot milk in three times [27], mixing well.
Add salt and flavor with nutmeg [28]. Continue to mix until you get a creamy béchamel [29]. Transfer to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set aside. As soon as 30 minutes have elapsed, take the dough back and take a piece [30]. Cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out.
With the help of a little semolina flatten it slightly on the pastry board to form a rectangle and roll out the dough in the machine [31]. Start from a wider thickness, then fold the dough and pass it over. When you feel it is too wet, sprinkle with a little semolina. Gradually reduce the thickness until you get a sheet just over 0.2 inches (0.5 mm) thick. Transfer it to a pastry board and cut into large rectangles 12x8 inches (30x20 cm) [32]. Continue this way until the dough is finished and in the meantime put a pot of water on the stove and add salt. When it starts to boil, immerse one sheet at a time [33],
wait 30-40 seconds and using a skimmer drain it [34]. Transfer it to a tray with a cloth [35] and dab to remove excess water. Continue this way, placing the cooked sheets side by side, without overlapping them. As soon as the Bolognese sauce is ready [36], season with salt and pepper and proceed to the composition of the lasagna.
Take a large 12x8 inches (30x20 cm) lasagna pan and grease the bottom [37]. Add a thin layer of béchamel and one of Bolognese sauce [38]. Then place the first sheet [39],
add a layer of béchamel and a layer of meat sauce [40]. Add grated Parmesan cheese [41] and place another sheet of pasta on top [42].
Add another layer of béchamel and one of meat sauce [43], add grated cheese [44] and continue like this until you have 5 layers. After placing the last sheet, add the Bolognese sauce [5]
in order to completely cover the pasta sheet [46]. Sprinkle with grated cheese, add some tufts of butter [47] and bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F (170°C) for 40 minutes [48].
