When imagination strikes, we must listen to it immediately. This is the mantra we have here at GialloZafferano... and numerous variations of the basic recipes are constantly coming out of our kitchen, such as macarons or cheesecake.  We always find inspiration and new combinations. Today the cream is the focus; starting from the classic recipe, we have transformed into an even more delicious preparation: chocolate custard cream. The love for chocolate is so strong that we couldn't resist dipping it into the mixture of milk, eggs and sugar: the result is a delicious velvety, melt-in-your-mouth texture. We are sure that you will also love our chocolate custard; it's so inviting that you will want to prepare muffins, sponge cake or other pastries to use it! Enjoy it with a spoonful of whipped cream and some crumbled macaroons: delicious!
