To prepare the veggie balls, first heat a pan full of cold salted water and immerse the potatoes [1] after washing them thoroughly. Cook them for a long time, around 35-40 minutes, then peel while still hot [2], mash with a potato masher, and place in a large bowl [3].
Then move on to the other vegetables, starting by washing them. Next, cut the leek into small rounds [4], the carrots into ¼-inch (0.5-cm) cubes [5], and the green beans into small chunks [6].
Cut the zucchini into small cubes like the carrots [7] and, lastly, finely chop the parsley [8]. Heat a large pan on the stove, and add the oil and the peeled clove of garlic [9].
As soon as the oil is flavored, remove the garlic and add in the leeks [10]. Let for a couple of minutes, then add the carrots [11] and a minute later the green beans [12].
Finally, add the zucchini [13], season with salt [14] and pepper, and cook for around 10 minutes, making sure that the vegetables remain slightly crunchy (if they dry out too much while cooking, you can moisten them with a couple of tablespoons of water). When the vegetables are ready, mix well [15] and leave to cool.
Now take the mashed potatoes and add the grated cheese [16], the lightly beaten eggs [17], salt, pepper [18], 
and nutmeg [19] to the same bowl. Add the now-lukewarm vegetables [20] and chopped parsley [21].
Mix thoroughly to obtain a mixture with the right consistency to work with [22] (if it is too soft you can add some more breadcrumbs, but don't overdo it or you risk making the balls too dry). Dampen your fingers and shape the balls, using around 1.75-2 oz (50-55 g) of mixture [23] for each. Place a bowl containing a beaten egg on the work surface, along with a tray of breadcrumbs. Dip each ball first in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs [24].
Keeping making balls until you run out of mixture [25]. Next, fry the balls in plenty of peanut oil, preheated to 350°F (180°C), turning them gently on both sides until golden brown [26]. Drain the balls and leave to dry on a paper towel before serving [27].
