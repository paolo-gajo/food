These veggie balls are a tasty, rustic main course popular with adults and children alike; crispy golden bites with a tasty and colorful filling of seasonal vegetables, all held together by cheese, eggs, and breadcrumbs, just the way that Grandma – who might even use them to stuff the meatloaf – used to make them. Veggie balls have long been a part of our country’s home-cooking tradition: from the need to feed the family with a tasty dish made from just a few rustic ingredients, to a mothers’ trick for getting their children to eat vegetables, we all have some sort of memory of this dish, which will take you right back to your childhood at first bite. Now that the boom that saw the rise in popularity of dishes that were often less healthy and more expensive is just a distant memory, we’re going back to a culture that’s more conscious of the need to reduce food waste as we rediscover simple dishes that incorporate leftovers. Of course, even though our recipe is for a “basic” veggie ball that uses the vegetables most commonly found in our kitchens, such as carrots, potatoes, and zucchini, we strongly recommend that you revisit it from time to time and tweak it with the seasonal vegetables you have in your garden (and refrigerator), such as mushrooms during the fall months, for example. That’s what these balls are all about, and there’s no more authentic or beautiful way to prepare and enjoy them.
