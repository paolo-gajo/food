To prepare fried panzerotti, start with the leavened dough. Pour flour 00 and manitoba flour [1] into a bowl, crumble fresh brewer's yeast [2] and add sugar [3]. 
Add half the water [4] and start working with a flat pastry cutter [5]. Then add salt [6],
the remaining water [7] and keep working with a flat pastry cutter [8]. Then add oil [9]
and start kneading with your hands [10]. As soon as the dough has taken on consistency, place it on a flat surface and knead for a few minutes until it is smooth and homogeneous [11]. Then shape into a sausage [12]
and cut it into 10 pieces of about 3 oz (80 g) each [13]. To form the balls, flatten a portion of dough on the work surface and bring all sides of the dough towards the center. Then pound each portion, gently squeezing with the palm of the hand towards the work surface and making a rotating movement [14]. Then place the balls on a tray, spaced well apart [15],
cover with a cloth [16] and let rise for an hour and a half, until they have doubled in volume. Meanwhile, make the filling. Cut the mozzarella into cubes [17] and put it to drain [18].
Heat a drizzle of oil [19] in a saucepan and pour in the tomato puree. Adjust the salt [20] and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes. When it is ready, transfer the sauce into a bowl, flavored with dried oregano [21].
Mix well and cool [22]. Take the balls, now risen [23]. Take one, pat it carefully on a lightly floured surface [24]
and then roll it with a rolling pin [25]. You will need to get a round disk about 1/10" (2 mm) thick. Place first the tomato puree [26] and then the mozzarella [27] in the center of each circle.
Close it by folding your dough in a crescent moon shape [28], taking sure to seal the ends carefully [29]. Trim the edge with a smooth wheel or a sharp knife [30].
At this point [31] heat plenty of vegetable oil in a saucepan at 325° F (170° C) and fry your panzerotti, 1 or 2 at a time [32]. As soon as they return to the surface, turn them over [33].
To cook them evenly, just turn them often [34]. Drain on absorbent paper [35] and continue cooking the others. When the panzerotti are ready, serve them hot [36]!
