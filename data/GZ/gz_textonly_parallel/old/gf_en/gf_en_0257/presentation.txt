Focaccia alla genovese, in dialect "f√ºgassa", is a typical Ligurian speciality and its ancient preparation is so deeply rooted in the Genoese tradition that it became part of the Slow Food movement. It is famous all over the world even though it's practically impossible to recreate its fragrance and goodness outside its territory of origin. So we relied on the mastery of the Ligurian chef Ezio Rocchi, to share the secrets to replicate it at home. The method we suggest is faster than what the Slow Food movement suggests (which indicates about 8 hours for the entire production process), although through the working, setting and resting phases you will have to wait a few hours before eating this extraordinary product. We respect the essential characteristics because we are talking about Genoese focaccia: a thickness of two centimeters as per tradition, balanced consistency between crunchiness and softness, crispness, gloss and, of course, make sure it's not rubbery!
