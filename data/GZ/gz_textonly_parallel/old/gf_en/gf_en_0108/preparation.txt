To prepare the stuffed pasta shells, start with the sauce. Peel and chop the onion in the mixer (1-2), or cut it finely with a knife. Then pour it into a saucepan together with a drizzle of oil [3] and turn the heat on.
Cook for about ten minutes over low heat, then add the tomato puree [4]. Add the salt, let it cook covered with the lid [5], for at least 45 minutes. The sauce should not be too dry, or you can add a little water to adjust the consistency. In the meantime, cut the mozzarella and make 6-7 thin slices and the rest of it into small cubes [6]. Put in a colander and let it drain.
Then start to prepare the meat: add a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic to another pan, leave to flavor for a few minutes over medium heat and then add the beef [7] and pork [8]. Turn up the flame and brown for about ten minutes until the bottom is dry, stirring often so it does not burn. Put a pot full of water on the burner which will be used to cook the pasta. When it comes to a boil, salt it. Once the meat sauce is dry, remove the garlic clove [9].
Blend with red wine [10] and let it evaporate completely. Finally add a pinch of salt [11] and let the liquids evaporate before turning the ehat off [12]; pour into a bowl and set aside.
It's time to cook the pasta in the boiling salted water [13]. Take care to drain it exactly halfway through the cooking time indicated on the package. Then put the pasta back in the pan, pour a little oil [14] on it and stir, taking care not to break the shells. Pour onto a tray to cool [15].
At this point you can start preparing the filling. Sieve the ricotta into a bowl [16] and then add the meat [17], the grated cheese [18],
the beaten egg [19], salt and pepper [20], now drain the mozzarella [21]
and just add the cubes to the filling, leaving the slices aside [22]. Mix everything well [23] and choose whether to fill the pasta with a teaspoon, one shell at a time, or use a sac à poche as we did. Take a baking pan, spread a layer of tomato sauce at the bottom [24].
As you fill the shells, place them inside the pan [25]. Once all the shells are stuffed, cover them with the tomato sauce [26] and place the slices of mozzarella [27] on top.
Season with grated cheese [28] and ground pepper to taste [29]. Bake in a preheated oven at 415° F (220° C) for about 20 minutes plus a few minutes on grill to brown the surface. Your stuffed shells are done, wait a few minutes before serving [30]!
