The essence of Sicily wrapped in a single pastry... unmistakable scents and textures bite after bite. Sicilian cannoli are the pride of this beautiful island, together with cassata, irises, almond pastries.... these are among the most popular desserts in the world. Served as a dessert in restaurants to be enjoyed in their original format or the mignon version, Sicilian cannoli are enchanting with their typical bubbled surface and the shimmering ricotta cream in the windows of pastry shops. They attract attention all along the streets of Sicilian towns or during events, sold as sweet street food to be filled at the last moment. Like all regional recipes, there are secrets and versions of Sicilian cannoli that change from city to city or family to family: some people choose to add cocoa and Marsala wine to the dough, just as we did. Others use a shell flavoring of coffee or cinnamon! The ricotta cream, on the other hand, is almost always enriched with chocolate bits and the finished cannoli are often garnished with pistachios, chocolate chips or candied fruit... in short, you will be spoiled with your choices in how to enjoy them! But the basic rule is this: cannoli must be filled at the last minute to enjoy all their crunchiness!
